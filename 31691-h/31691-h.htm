<h4>PREFACE</h4>

<p>This book has been designed with a view to meet
an extensive demand for definite data on the subject
of Soured Milks. The author has had this
matter brought before him, times without number,
by those inquiring for authentic information on the
subject, and he has therefore considered it desirable
to gather together such information as is
available in connection with ancient and modern
practice. He has endeavoured to present this to
the reader in concise form.</p>

<p>The author is indebted to many friends for their
assistance in getting the book together, and would
specially mention Dr. H. B. Hutchinson, Bacteriologist,
Rothamsted Experimental Station, for
assistance in connection with the bacteriology of
fermented milks; Mr. Thomas Douglas, of Wimbledon,
who has assisted with the chemistry of the
subject; Mr. S. Javrilovitch, of Belgrade, Servia,
for local information and illustrations; Dr. Otokar
Laxa, Bacteriologist, of Prague, Bohemia, for
general assistance; the editor of <i>Bacteriotherapy</i>,
New York, U.S.A., for the use of the group of
illustrations 30-44; the publishers of the <i>Centralblatt
f&uuml;r Bakteriologie</i>, Jena, for the group of illustrations
14-29; and many others, some of whom
are referred to in the text.</p>

<h2>THE BACILLUS OF
LONG LIFE</h2>



<hr />
<h4>CHAPTER I</h4>

<h5>INTRODUCTORY&mdash;HISTORICAL</h5>


<p>The milk industry is one of the oldest known to
mankind, and it is difficult to imagine a time when
milk in one way or another did not form a part of
the diet of the human race. There is a good deal of
evidence to show that in Paleolithic and Neolithic
times, cattle were part of the possessions of the
nomadic races; and, according to the Vedas, the
manufacture of butter was known in India 1500
years <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In the eastern part of Europe, milk has always
been looked upon as one of the principal kinds of
food, but not necessarily the milk of cows, as, from
ancient times to the present day, the milk from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
camels, buffaloes, sheep, and goats has been used
indiscriminately throughout the East.</p>

<p>According to Layard,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> "the Bedouins do not
make cheese. The milk of their sheep and goats is
shaken into butter or turned into curds; it is rarely
or never drunk fresh, new milk being thought very
unwholesome, as soon by experience I found it to
be, in the desert. I have frequently had occasion to
describe the process of making butter by shaking
the milk in skins. This is also an employment confined
to women, and one of a very laborious nature.
The curds are formed by boiling the milk, and then
putting some curds made on the previous day into
it and allowing it to stand. When the sheep no
longer give milk, some curds are dried, to be used as
a leaven on a future occasion. This preparation,
called <i>leben</i>, is thick and acid, but very agreeable
and grateful to the taste in a hot climate. The sour
milk, or <i>sheneena</i>, a universal beverage amongst
the Arabs, is either buttermilk pure and diluted, or
curds mixed with water.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="bukova" id="bukova"></a><img src="images/bukova.jpg" width="500" height="376" alt=
"The Pass of Bukova."
title="" />

<p class="indent2"><span class="smcap">The Pass of Bukova.</span>&mdash;During the revolution of 1904, a number of Turkish soldiers, just before traversing
this pass, were given coffee containing "caf&eacute;" by a Bulgarian coffee-seller, or keeper of a small
khan. Whilst in the pass the poison began to take effect, and they realized that they had been poisoned.
Fortunately for them, a peasant with three horses loaded with Yoghourt (soured milk) had taken
advantage of their escort. The soldiers ate freely of the Yoghourt, which counteracted the effects of
the poison.</p>
</div>

<p>"The camel's milk is drunk fresh. It is pleasant
to the taste, rich, and exceedingly nourishing. It is
given in large quantities to the horses. The Shammar
and Aneyza Bedouins have no cows or oxen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>those animals being looked upon as the peculiar
property of tribes who have forgotten their independence,
and degraded themselves by the cultivation
of land. The sheep are milked at dawn,
or even before daybreak, and again in the evening
on their return from the pastures. The milk is
immediately turned into leben, or boiled to be
shaken into butter. Amongst the Bedouins and
Jebours it is considered derogatory to the character
of a man to milk a cow or sheep, but not to
milk the camel. The Sheikhs occasionally obtain
dates from the cities. They are eaten dry with
bread and leben, or fried in butter, a very favourite
dish of the Bedouin...."</p>


<p>The practice is now the same as it was in scriptural
times, when milk was looked upon as the
principal article of diet, and throughout the Scriptures
there are copious references to milk in different
forms, some of which are of peculiar interest at
the present day.</p>

<p>It may be noticed, for example, that milk is
absent from the sacred offerings amongst the
Hebrews, and this was ascribed by the late Professor
Robertson Smith to the fact that all ferments
were excluded from presentation at the altar,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>being recognised that, owing to the hot climate,
milk of all kinds became rapidly sour, and in this
way came to be looked upon as only fit for consumption
when in that condition. It has been
suggested that the prohibition referred to is on
the same level as the prohibition of the use of
blood, "as milk has sometimes been regarded as a
kind of equivalent for blood, and containing the
sacred life."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> To this day the wandering tribes
of Arabia consider the milk of their camels and
flocks more refreshing when it has been slightly
fermented or soured by being poured into a milk-skin
on the inside of which are still sticking sour
clots from the previous milking, and there shaken
for a brief period; but this slightly soured milk
(the <i>Oxygala</i> of Pliny) is known widely in the
East simply as leben (milk). The name is also
applied to what we term buttermilk.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="kabyles" id="kabyles"></a><img src="images/kabyles.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt=
"Kabyles Souring Milk."
title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Kabyles Souring Milk</span></p>
<p class="indent">
In the north of Africa the use of soured milk is common, and the illustration shows Kabyles shaking a
skin full of milk so as to sour it. The skin has previously been used for the same operation, and, as
a consequence, clots of milk are left from the previous day's use, and thus fermentation is set up.
</p>
</div>


<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>The use of milk-skins for the carrying of milk is
not confined to one country, as, while it is common
all over the north of Africa, it is also known in the
Pyrenees and in some parts of the Balkan Peninsula,
the object being identical in each case; and
when it is intended to make butter from the milk,
the skin is simply rocked between the knees until
the butter separates, a process of butter-making
which was also used after the introduction of
earthenware churns.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Dried soured milk is also
used by the Arabs, and it is reconstituted when
required by rubbing it up with a little water, and
it is known as <i>Meeresy</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> The ordinary soured
milk is the common article of diet, and is looked
upon as being necessary at every meal, and travellers
frequently refer to the use of this product, as
a few references will show.</p>

<p>Amongst the peasants at the present day, soured
milk is known as _yoghourt_, a word which is spelt
differently according to the locality in which it is
used. The method of preparation is practically the
same everywhere, and a short description of the
process as now carried out in one place would, with
slight modifications, apply to the general method
adopted all over the East.</p>

<p>Charles G. Addison states: "A supper was
brought in on a round tray. In the centre was
a huge pilaff of rice, and around it several small
dishes of stewed meats, grilled bones, sour clotted
milk called <i>yaoort</i>,<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> bits of meat roasted, etc....</p>

<p>"We retired into a tent to breakfast, where
we found an immense bowl of delicious fresh
camels' milk, with thin hot cakes of unleavened
bread, baked upon the ashes, ready prepared for
us. The principal food of the Bedouins consists
of flour and some camels' milk made into a paste,
boiled, and eaten swimming in melted grease and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>butter; boiled wheat and beans dried in the sun and
prepared with butter are a favourite dish. They
are all remarkably fond of butter and grease; the
butter is made in a goat-skin, suspended to
the tent pole, and constantly shaken about by
the women."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>Burckhardt<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> says: "The provisions of my companion
consisted only of flour; besides flour, I
carried some butter and dried leben (sour milk),
which would dissolve in water. It forms not only
a refreshing beverage, but is much to be recommended
as a preservative of health when travelling
in summer. These are our only provisions." With
regard to the inhabitants of the Houran, Burckhardt
relates that the most common dishes of these
people are <i>bourgoul</i> and <i>keshk</i>. "In summer
they supply the place of the latter by milk, leben,
and fresh butter. Of the bourgoul I have spoken
on other occasions; there are two kinds of keshk&mdash;<i>keshk-hammer</i>
and <i>keshk-leben</i>. The first is prepared
by putting leaven into the bourgoul and
pouring water over it. It is then left until almost
putrid, and afterwards spread out in the sun and
dried, after which it is pounded, and, when called
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>for, served up mixed with oil or butter. The keshk-leben
is prepared by putting leben into the bourgoul
instead of leaven; in other respects the process
is the same. Keshk and bread are the common
breakfasts. Towards sunset a plate of bourgoul,
or some Arab dish, forms the dinner."</p>

<p>Again, Taylor<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> says: "I received a small jug
of thick buttermilk, not remarkably clean, but
very refreshing."</p>

<p>These references particularly refer to the East,
from which it would appear that soured milk was
universally known in ancient times as it is at the
present day, and this remark applies not only
to Egypt, Palestine, and Arabia, but throughout
Turkey and the Balkan States, where the consumption
of soured milk is equally common. It
seems curious that the use of this commodity
should have been confined for centuries to the
East, as we shall see later on that its dietetic
value is so great that it is really a wonderful
thing that no one has taken the trouble to introduce
its use to the Western nations until quite
recently.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Handling OF Milk in the Pyrenees</span></p>
<p class="indent">
The handling of milk in the Pyrenees is, more especially
in the villages, conducted in goat or sheep skins, in a
similar way to the methods which prevail in Eastern
Europe, and the picture shows a skin of milk on a small
farm in the Pyrenees. The churning is very often performed
by simply rocking the skin between the knees, acidity
being induced by remnants of the previous day's milk;
souring of milk is induced by the same method.</p></div>

<p>A curious example of how the virtues of such
an article may be independently discovered by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>another nation is to be found in Lapland, where
reindeer's milk is the article used. "The reindeer's
milk," says Acerbi,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> "constitutes a principal part
of the Laplander's food, and he has two methods
of preparing it, according to the season. In summer
he boils the milk with sorrel till it arrives
to a consistence; in this manner he preserves it
for use during that short season. In winter the
following is his method of preparation: The milk,
which he collects in autumn till the beginning
of November, from the reindeer, is put into casks,
or whatever vessels he has, in which it soon turns
sour, and, as the cold weather comes on, freezes,
and in this state it is kept. The milk collected
after this time is mixed with cranberries and put
into the paunch of the reindeer, well cleaned
from filth; thus the milk soon congeals, and it
is cut out in slices, together with the paunch, to
effect which a hatchet is used, for no smaller
instrument would perform the office of dividing
that lump of ice. It is then separated into small
pieces and eaten throughout the winter every day
at noon, which is the Laplander's dinner-hour. It
must be presumed, as it is served up without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
being brought to the fire, that this is ice-cream in
the greatest perfection: here are flesh and fruit
blended with the richest butyraceous milk that can
be drawn from any animal; but, notwithstanding
the extraordinary fatness, which may be supposed
to resist in a great degree the effect of cold, this
preparation, as our good missionary remarks with
a degree of feeling, as if his teeth still chattered
whilst he delivered the account, chills and freezes
the mouth in a violent manner whenever it is
taken. The milk which is drawn late in the
winter freezes immediately after being drawn.
This is put into small vessels made of birchwood,
and is considered by the Laplander as such an
extraordinary delicacy, that he reserves it as the
most acceptable present he can offer even a missionary.
It is placed before the fire and eaten
with a spoon as it is thawed. When put by, it
is carefully covered up, because if the cold air gets
to it afterwards, it turns of a yellow colour and
becomes rancid."</p>

<p>Amongst the peasants at the present day, soured
milk is known as <i>yoghourt</i>, a word which is spelt
differently according to the locality in which it is
used. The method of preparation is practically the
same everywhere, and a short description of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
process as now carried out in one place would, with
slight modifications, apply to the general method
adopted all over the East.</p>

<p>"The culture," says a correspondent at Varna,
"which is used for the preparation of yogourt, is
known as 'Maya' or as 'Bulgarian Maya.' The
milk which is to be converted into yogourt must
first be freed from all bacteria by boiling and allowed
to cool to the temperature of 45&deg; C.; it is then
inoculated with maya and maintained at an even
temperature of 45&deg; C. during several hours. There
are two kinds of maya, or ferment, one known as
sour, and the other as sweet maya.</p>

<p>"In Europe small stoves, made expressly for the
purpose, are used to maintain the milk at the
proper temperature. In this country, however,
after the milk has been boiled, it is merely poured
into a bowl and allowed to cool to approximately
45&deg; C., then a tablespoonful of this tepid milk
is well mixed (in a small bowl apart) with a similar
quantity of maya, and the mixture, when it has
become quite homogeneous, is added to the bowl
of tepid milk and stirred slightly. (One tablespoonful
of maya is sufficient to ferment one litre
of milk.) A cover is then placed on the bowl
and the whole is enveloped in flannel and left in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
a warm place for three hours in summer, and
somewhat longer in winter.</p>

<p>"The process of preparation is complete when
the mixture assumes the appearance of a soft mass
somewhat resembling cream cheese, but less solid.
The flannel is then removed, the bowl uncovered
and placed in a cool spot until needed for consumption.
Of the yogourt thus prepared, a
tablespoonful is kept to serve as maya for the
following day.</p>

<p>"The best yogourt is prepared from sheep's
milk, the second quality from buffaloes' milk, and
the third quality from cows' milk. Yogourt forms
an almost daily article of diet with the natives in
this country."<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>With regard to the time stated for the fermenting
process, it must be noted that since the subject has
been investigated so thoroughly, the time required
for fermentation has been found to be nearer ten
than three hours, but this will be dealt with in a
subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>Historically it may be gleaned from the fragmentary
references which we have given, that
soured milk has, from time immemorial, formed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
the principal article of diet of a great many
peoples, and the notable feature in connection
with it is, that in some countries where it is in daily
use, the age limit for human beings seems to be
very much extended, and it would appear that
there is a direct connection between the use of
soured milk and longevity. In Bulgaria, for
example, it is stated that the majority of the
natives live to an age considerably in excess of
what is recognised as the term of life amongst
Western nations, and inquiry has shown that
in the eastern part of Southern Europe, amongst
a population of about three millions, there were
more than three thousand centenarians found
performing duties which would not be assigned
to a man of sixty-five years of age elsewhere. It
is quite common to find amongst the peasants
who live to such a large extent upon soured milk,
individuals of 110 and 120 years of age.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>In the ancient dairy practice, as we have seen,
soured milk was the principal product, and the
extraordinary ages which are recorded of the patriarchs,
if translated into the modern denomination,
would not appear to be so imaginary after all,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>when it is considered that we have thousands of
examples at the present day of men and women
enjoying quite as long a term of existence. It has
been noticed also, that while these very old people
are able to perform a certain amount of manual
labour, there is not the same tendency to the
mental decay which is so prominent and sad a
feature amongst Western nations, at a period of
about seventy or eighty years of age. It would
seem, indeed, as if the habit of living long was well
known in ancient times, and that, like many other
of the valuable arts and sciences, it fell under a
cloud during the Middle Ages, or, perhaps, the
significance of the use of soured milk fell into
neglect, and, even after the revival of letters in
the sixteenth century, still remained obscure.</p>

<p>The discovery of micro-organisms in perishable
products, which is attributable to Anthony Van
Leeuwenhoek, a Dutchman, whose vocation was
the polishing of lenses, and who lived between
1632 and 1723, altered our point of view, not only
of disease, but of all the functions carried on by
the lower organisms. Since Van Leeuwenhoek's
time, the germ theory has grown to vast proportions
and has more especially been applied with
splendid results to the study of milk. As we shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
see later, the researches of modern investigators
have led them to the conclusion that micro-organisms
play such an important part in the milk
supply, that it is impossible to carry it on safely
without a knowledge of the bacteriology of the
subject. This view began to prevail about 1890,
some twenty years after Pasteur had shown what
fermentation really meant. Since that time, the
progress in dairying has been continuous, and,
during recent years, attention has been directed to
soured milk to such an extent that it has become
necessary for all who are interested in the handling
of milk and milk products to have a knowledge of
the subject, as it seems clearly demonstrated that,
under proper direction, there is every possibility of
its forming an important element in the prolongation
of life.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II</h4>

<h5>FERMENTED MILKS</h5>


<p>There is considerable variety in the number of
soured or fermented milks, and they are known by
various names, such as Koumiss or Koomiss, which
is prepared from mares' milk; Keffir, which was
originally discovered in the mountains of the Caucasus,
and which is prepared with Keffir grains;
Leben, an Egyptian product prepared from the
milk of the buffalo, cow, or goat; Matzoon, a
soured milk which is prepared in Armenia from
ordinary cows' milk; Dadhi, an Indian preparation
from cows' milk. All of these owe their special
characteristics to the fact of their having undergone
lactic and alcoholic fermentation.</p>

<p>"Milk left to itself," says Blyth,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> "at all temperatures
above 90&deg; F. begins to evolve carbon
dioxide, and this is simply a sign and result of
fermentation. If this fermentation is arrested
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>or prevented, the fluid remains perfectly sweet and
good for an indefinite time. Besides the production
of carbon dioxide during decomposition,
a certain portion of milk sugar is converted into
lactic acid, some of the casein and albumen are
broken up into simpler constituents, and a small
proportion of alcohol produced, which by oxidation
appears as acetic acid, while the fat is in part
separated into free fatty acids, which ultimately
unite with the ammonia produced by the breaking
up of the albuminoids. The main fermentation
of milk is a special kind which of late years has
been much studied, and is known as <i>lactic fermentation</i>.
Accompanying lactic fermentation there
is nearly always a weak butyric and a weak
alcoholic fermentation."</p>

<p>One of the organisms causing <i>Butyric Acid
Fermentation</i> is a bacillus 3 to 10&micro; in length, and
about 1&micro; in breadth. It has power of movement,
and when cultivated in gelatine, liquefies the gelatine,
forming a scum on the surface. When the
bacillus is sown into sterile milk, the following,
according to Hueppe, are the changes:</p>

<p>"If the milk thus infected is incubated, on the
second day a clear, slightly yellow fluid is seen
under the layer of cream; this fluid increases from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
day to day, so that gradually a column of fluid
is formed which is quite clear above, but below is
turbid; the casein, at first thrown down in a firm
coagulum, in the course of eight days begins to be
attacked, and by the end of two or three weeks
most of it is dissolved. The filtered fluid gives
the biuret reaction; it contains leucin, tyrosin, and
ammonia; hence it is clear that the ferment acts
to some extent as a digestive of albumen. In advanced
butyric acid fermentation, the fluid is most
offensive, and may have an alkaline reaction."</p>

<p>Lactic acid was first isolated by Scheele in 1780
from soured milk, but its exact constitution was
not determined until later by Liebig, Mitscherlich,
Gay-Lussac, and Pelouze: "It is widely distributed
in nature, occurring in the sap of the vine and in
most fermented liquids, especially in soured milk;
it is not, however, present in fresh milk."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>


<p>In all the Eastern preparations referred to, the
lactic fermentation is produced, followed by alcoholic
fermentation, which is due to the slow decomposition
of the milk sugar, the vinous fermentation
being most readily set up in milks which contain a
larger relative proportion of milk sugar and water,
such as the milk derived from the mare, the sheep,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>and the camel. As these fermented milks have
different characteristics, it is necessary to the
thorough understanding of the process of manufacture
at the present day, to examine them in
some detail.</p>

<p><i>Koumiss.</i>&mdash;The greatest of all the fermented
milks is koumiss, and it has been celebrated from
the most ancient times until the present day, as
being the principal food of the wandering tribes of
Khirgiz, Bashkirs, Kalmucks, and Tartars, who
inhabit the steppes of European Russia and the
plains of South, Western, and Central Asia.
According to Carrick, who has written an interesting
volume on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> the nomads who
inhabit these vast territories are shut up under the
most miserable circumstances during the winter
time and at the advent of spring they roam over the
steppes from morning to night, usually in the saddle.
The milk yielded at such time by the mares is
carefully collected, and these nomads consume
enormous quantities of it in the fermented state,
this habit having been in existence amongst them
from time immemorial. It is said that the Scythians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
long before the Christian era, used fermented
mares' milk; and there are ornaments in existence
in Russia, of Scythian origin, which exhibit in
detail the preparation of koumiss from mares'
milk. In historical times, the first mention of
koumiss was in the twelfth century, when it is
referred to in the Ipatof Chronicles. During the
thirteenth century William de Rubruquis, a French
missionary, wrote about his travels in Tartary,
and he described how he had first become
acquainted with koumiss, and how he found it
savoury to the palate. Subsequent to this, however,
there is very little mention of koumiss in
Russian history, or, for that matter, in any other,
and the first really scientific contribution on the
subject was by Dr. John Grieve, who was a surgeon
in the Russian army, and who in the year
1784 sent a description of koumiss to the Royal
Society of Edinburgh,<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> of which he was a member,
and the title of it was, "An Account of the Method
of Making Wine called by the Tartars Koumiss,
with Observations on its Use as a Medicine."
Dr. Grieve strongly advocated the use of
koumiss as beneficial in cases of wasting diseases,
and subsequently it was adopted by the medical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
profession, with the result that sanatoria for the
treatment of pulmonary consumption were established
at Samara and other places in Russia, and
met with very great success; and at the present
day such sanatoria are carried on, but the bacteriology
of the subject now being thoroughly
understood, the methods of preparation have been
somewhat modified.</p>

<p>An interesting account of koumiss is given by
Clarke,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> who says:</p>

<p>"Everybody has heard of koumiss, and the
brandy which the Kalmucks are said to distil from
the milk of mares. The manner of preparing these
liquids has been differently related, and perhaps is
not always the same. They assured us that the
brandy was merely distilled from buttermilk. The
milk which they collect overnight is churned in
the morning into butter; and the buttermilk is
distilled over a fire made with the dung of their
cattle, particularly the dromedary, which makes a
steady and clear fire like peat. But other accounts
have been given both of the koumiss and the
brandy. It has been usual to confound them, and
to consider the koumiss as their appellation for
the brandy so obtained. By other information I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>could gain, not only here, but in many other
camps which we afterwards visited, they are
different modifications of the same thing although
different liquors; the koumiss being a kind of
sour milk, like that so much used by the Laplanders
called <i>pina</i>, and which has undergone, in a certain
degree, the vinous fermentation; and the brandy
an ardent spirit obtained from koumiss by distillation.
In making koumiss they sometimes
employ the milk of cows, but never if mares' milk
can be had, as the koumiss from the latter yields
three times as much brandy as that made from
cows' milk.</p>

<p>"The manner of preparing the koumiss is, by
combining one sixth part of warm water with any
given quantity of warm mares' milk. To these they
add, as a leaven, a little old koumiss, and agitate
the mass till fermentation ensues. To produce
the vinous fermentation, artificial heat and more
agitation is sometimes necessary. This affords
what is called koumiss. The subsequent process
of distillation afterwards obtains an ardent spirit
from the koumiss. They call it <i>vina</i>. In their
own language it bears the very remarkable appellation
of <i>rack</i> and <i>racky</i>, doubtless nearly allied
to the names of our East India spirit <i>rack</i> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
<i>arrack</i>. We brought away a quart bottle of it,
and considered it very weak bad brandy, not
unlike the common spirit distilled by the Swedes
and other northern nations. Some of their women
were busy making it in an adjoining tent. The
simplicity of the operation and their machinery
was very characteristic of the antiquity of this
chemical process. Their still was constructed of
mud, or very coarse clay; and for the neck of the
retort they employed a cane. The receiver of
the still was entirely covered by a coating of wet
clay. The brandy had already passed over.
The woman who had the management of the distillery,
wishing to give us a taste of the spirit,
thrust a stick, with a small tuft of camel's hair at its
end, through the external covering of clay, and
thus collecting a small quantity of the brandy,
she drew out the stick, dropped a portion on the
retort, and, waving the instrument above her head,
scattered the remaining liquor in the air. I asked
the meaning of this ceremony, and was answered
that it is a religious custom to give always the first
drop of the brandy which they draw from the
receiver to their God. The stick having been
plunged into the receiver again, she squeezed it
into the palm of her dirty and greasy hand, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
after tasting the liquor, presented it to our lips."</p>

<p>Another interesting account of the preparation
of koumiss is given by John M. Wilson in the
<i>Rural Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and it shows that the methods
in use about the middle of last century did not
differ materially from those which existed centuries
before.</p>

<p>Wilson says: "Khoumese is vinously fermented
mares' milk. Any quantity of fresh mares' milk
is put into wooden vessels; a sixth part of water
just off the boil is mixed with it; an eighth part of
old khoumese or of the sourest possible cows' milk
is added; the mixture is kept from fifteen to twenty-four
hours, covered up with several folds of coarse
linen cloth and with a very thick board, and without
being stirred or in any degree disturbed, in a
moderately warm place till it becomes thoroughly
sour, and sends up a thick mass to its surface; it
is then beaten and pounded and stirred till the
curd is not only broken, but so thoroughly mixed
with the serum as to form a thick liquid; it next
remains covered and at rest during twenty-four
hours more, and it is finally put into a common
butter churn and beaten and blended into a state
of perfect homogeneity. It is now fit for use;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>yet it acquires an increase of given properties if
it be allowed to stand for a few days, and either
then or now it would, if distilled, yield nearly
one third of its own bulk of a weak spirit which
will bear to be rectified. Whenever it is used it
must be previously so agitated that its component
parts may be well mixed together, and it may be
kept either in pans for immediate use or in casks
for more remote use; and if placed in a cool cellar
it will remain good during three or four months."</p>

<p>Mares' milk owes its peculiar fitness for making
koumiss to its containing a large proportion of
sugar of milk, and readily undergoing the vinous
fermentation, and it possesses a general medicinal
reputation among the Tartars similar to that which
asses' milk has partially acquired in Britain.
"That mares' milk will undergo vinous fermentation
and yield a certain quantity of spirit," says
a writer in the <i>Magazine of Domestic Economy</i>,
"is not generally known, and it was reserved for a
nation of demi-savages to render this circumstance
available as an agent of health, as well as an agreeable
and nourishing beverage. Every educated
person, however, has heard that the Tartars drink
mares' milk, though few know that this milk is
taken on account of its specific virtues alone, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
not as a substitute for cows' milk, of which they
have abundance, and with which they adulterate
mares' milk when scarce." But the koumiss
is reputed to be much more medicinal than the
mares' milk itself; and on account of its being free
from all tendency to curdle in the stomach, and
of its possessing most of the nutritive power of
the milk in combination with native fermented
spirit, it has been strongly recommended by some
persons as a remedy for most or all cases of general
debility, of nervous languor, and even pulmonary
disease.</p>

<p>"Khoumese is called sometimes <i>koumiss</i> and
sometimes milk wine."</p>

<p>From these references it will be seen that koumiss
is an alcoholic drink made by the fermentation
of mares' milk, but it is also frequently prepared
from the milk of the camel and cows' milk. It is
stated that a similar preparation to Russian koumiss
is made in Switzerland from cows' milk simply
by the addition of a little sugar and yeast to skim
milk; "it contains more sugar and less lactic acid
than Russian koumiss, and on account of the much
greater proportion of casein contained in cows'
milk, differs considerably from that prepared from
mares' milk." Suter-Naef gives the composition
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
of a Swiss koumiss<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> manufactured at Davos as

<p>The ferments used in the preparation of koumiss
are stated by Carrick to be of two different kinds,
artificial and natural.</p>

<p>"Of the natural ferments two have been resorted
to. One is mentioned by Grieve, which he borrowed
from the Bashkirs of Orenbourg, and which
simply consists in the addition of one sixth part of
water and one eighth of the sourest cows' milk to
fresh mares' milk; the other has been employed,
and was, if I mistake not, first recommended by
Bogoyavlensky. It is a very simple if rather a
tedious method. New mares' milk, diluted with
one third its bulk of water, is placed in the <i>saba</i>,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
and while allowed to sour spontaneously, is continually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
beaten up. This milk gradually undergoes
the vinous fermentation, and in twenty-four
hours is converted into weak koumiss. The disadvantage
of this mode of commencing fermentation
is obvious&mdash;viz., the great waste of time in
agitation. Hence it is only employed when no
artificial ferment is obtainable.</p>

<p>"In starting the process of fermentation in
mares' or any other kind of milk, therefore, an
artificial ferment is more frequently employed
than a natural one. The former is used only for
converting the first portion of milk into koumiss;
the latter is always resorted to afterwards.</p>

<p>"Of artificial ferments the variety is great, for
besides all putrefying animal matters which contain
nitrogen&mdash;such as blood, white of egg, glue,
and flesh&mdash;certain mineral substances which act
by souring the milk are also capable of exciting
fermentation.</p>

<p>"Now, many of the nomads, whose mares either
give no milk or are not milked in winter, commence
the preparation of their koumiss in spring by borrowing
a ferment from the animal, mineral, or
vegetable kingdom. Thus a mixture of honey and
flour is the favourite ferment with some races of
nomads; a piece of fresh horse-skin or tendon is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
preferred by others, while a few resort to old copper
coins, covered with verdigris, for starting fermentation.
In the choice of a ferment they are guided
solely by habit and tradition. As it would be
useless, almost impossible, to give a list of all the
foreign substances that have been employed with
the view of converting mares' milk into koumiss, it
will be best to consider the simplest artificial ferments,
and those most generally in use.</p>

<p>"The simplest way is that recommended by
Bogoyavlensky, and adopted and modified by
Tchembulatof.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> It is prepared thus: 'Take a
quarter of a pound of millet-flour, add water to it,
and boil it down to the consistence of thick oatmeal
porridge. Then heat separately, in another
vessel, eleven pints of milk to boiling-point, and
allow it to cool down. When its temperature has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>fallen to 95&deg; F., pour it into a wooden bowl or tub,
and add the boiled flour to it. The upper and open
part of the vessel is then covered with a piece of
coarse linen, and left at rest&mdash;at a temperature of
about 99&deg; F.&mdash;from twenty-four to forty-eight
hours. The appearance of small bubbles, which
keep bursting on the surface of this liquid, combined
with a vinous or acid odour, prove that the
ferment is ready. To this fermenting fluid twenty-two
quarts of new milk are gradually (<i>i.e.</i>, every ten
minutes) added, and the whole mass is continuously
beaten up for twelve hours. The temperature during
stirring should never be higher than 94&deg; F. The
whole fluid soon begins to ferment, and after twelve
hours a not unpleasant koumiss is ready. This
should be filtered through a horse-hair or muslin
sieve, after which it is fit for drinking. This
liquid is called weak koumiss; but a limited portion
of the lactine has undergone the lactuous and
vinous fermentations, and thus the percentage of
alcohol is small. Koumiss at an ordinary temperature
remains weak for twelve hours after it has
been beaten up, and then gradually passes into
medium.'"</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the richness of cows' milk in
fat militates against its being a good raw material
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
for the making of koumiss, owing to the production
of small quantities of butyric acid, which follows
upon the fermentation, so that it is desirable, if
koumiss is to be prepared from cows' milk, that
the fat should be first of all eliminated, so that the
separated milk will then approximate to the composition
of mares' milk.</p>

<p>"The chemical changes," says Hutchison,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
"which take place in the milk under the double
fermentation are not difficult to follow; the lactic
ferment simply changes part of the sugar into
lactic acid, the vinous ferment eats up a very small
part of the proteid of the milk, and, at the same
time, produces from the sugar a little alcohol and
a good deal of carbon dioxide; the milk thus
becomes sour, it effervesces and is weakly alcoholic,
but the lactic acid causes the casein to be precipitated
just as it does in the ordinary souring of
milk, and the casein falls down in flocculi."</p>

<p>As will have been noticed, it is an essential part
of the process of koumiss-making to keep the milk
in a state of agitation during the period of fermentation,
a process which is intended to permit of
oxygen being taken up by the fermenting fluid,
while, at the same time, the casein is broken up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>into a state of fine division. The casein also, or at
least a portion of it, becomes very soluble, and after
twelve hours of fermentation the taste of the product
is only slightly sour, and the milk taste still
remains. This taste, however, disappears in twenty-four
hours, owing to the rapid development of the
lactic acid organisms. After this lapse of time
the sugar is entirely destroyed, and the strong
koumiss which results is a thin sour fluid which
effervesces briskly, and in this condition will keep
for an indefinite period. "The net change which
has taken place in the original milk may be summed
up by saying that the sugar of the milk has been
replaced by lactic acid, alcohol, and carbon dioxide,
the casein has been partly precipitated in a state
of very fine division, and partly pre-digested and
dissolved, while the fat and salts have been left
much as they were."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>Violent stirring or agitation of the cultures does
not seem to work so much by supplying oxygen to
the fermenting liquid, as by ensuring a thorough
distribution of the micro-organisms throughout
the liquid, and thus dividing the casein.</p>

<p>The greater number of the organisms are facultative
an&aelig;robes and oxygen is not necessary.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>Again, koumiss put up in bottles on the first day is
regularly shaken although air is excluded.</p>

<p><i>Keffir.</i>&mdash;Keffir is a kind of fermented milk which
has been in use in the Caucasus for quite a long
time, as koumiss has been in the steppes. It
differs from koumiss, however, in this respect, that
it is prepared from either sheep's, goats', or cows'
milk. The process is started by the addition of
keffir grains to the milk, which is contained in
leathern bottles. These keffir grains are small
solid kernels which are kept in families and handed
on from one generation to another.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> The grains
are the origin of the ferment, as they disseminate
in the milk micro-organisms of a lactic yeast
(<i>Saccharomyces kefir</i> Beyerinck and Freudenreich)
and also the bacillus <i>Bacterium caucasicum</i>, which
develop rapidly and split up the milk sugar into
carbon dioxide, alcohol, and lactic acid. Small
quantities of glycerine, acetic, succinic, and butyric
acids are also formed, the casein and albumen being
partly peptonised.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Keffir becomes slightly effervescent
in twenty-four hours, and in that time
develops a small quantity of alcohol, but after
three days the amount of alcohol and lactic acid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
is much increased.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> It has been determined that
the fermentation of the milk is due to <i>Saccharomyces
kefir</i>, and that the <i>Lactobacillus Caucasicus</i>
does not take any part in the fermentation, a fact
which seems to be supported by the capacity of
ordinary keffir for starting the fermentation in fresh
milk in the same manner as the keffir grains. The
use of this beverage seems to be universal throughout
the Caucasus, and travellers in these regions
have frequently referred to it. Thus Freshfield<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
states in one part of his book of travels as follows:</p>

<p>"The pig-faced peasant against whom we had
at first sight conceived such an unjust prejudice
turned out a capital fellow. He brought us not
only fresh milk, but a peculiar species of liquor,
something between public-house beer and sour
cider, for which we expressed the greatest admiration,
taking care at the same time privately
to empty out the vessel containing it, on the first
opportunity." And again:</p>

<p>"The hospitable shepherds regaled us, not only
with the inevitable and universal airam or sour
milk&mdash;if a man cannot reconcile himself to sour
milk, he is not fit for the Caucasus&mdash;but with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>local delicacy that has lately been brought to the
knowledge of Europe&mdash;kefir. This may best be
described as 'effervescing milk.' It is obtained by
putting into the liquid some yellow grains, parts
of a mushroom which contains a bacillus known to
science as <i>Dispora caucasia</i>. The action of the
grains is to decompose the sugar in the milk, and
to produce carbonic acid and alcohol. The grains
multiply indefinitely in the milk; when dried they
can be preserved and kept for future use; its
results on the digestion are frequently unsatisfactory,
as one of my companions learnt to his
cost."</p>


<p>"It has been supposed," says Metchnikoff,
"that the chief merit of kephir was that it was
more easy to digest than milk, as some of its
casein is dissolved in the process of fermentation.
Kephir, in fact, was supposed to be partly digested
milk. This view has not been confirmed. Professor
Hayem thinks that the good effects of kephir
are due to the presence of alcoholic acid, which
replaces the acid of the stomach and has an antiseptic
effect. The experiments of M. Rovigh,
which I speak of in <i>The Nature of Man</i>, have confirmed
the latter fact, which now may be taken
as certain. The action of kephir in preventing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
intestinal putrefaction depends on the lactic acid
bacillus which it contains. Kephir, although in
some cases certainly beneficial, cannot be recommended
for the prolonged use necessary, if intestinal
putrefaction is to be overcome.... Professor
Hayem prohibits its use in the case of persons in
whom food is retained for long in the stomach.
When it is retained in the stomach, kephir goes on
fermenting, and there are developed in the contents
butyric and acetic acids, which aggravate the
digestive disturbances. Kephir is produced by
combined lactic and alcoholic fermentations ... and
it is the lactic and not the alcoholic fermentation
on which the valuable properties of kephir
depend; it is correct to replace it by sour milk,
that contains either no alcohol or merely the smallest
traces of it. The fact that so many races make
sour milk and use it copiously is an excellent testimony
of its usefulness."</p>

<p>There are two methods given by Fl&uuml;gge<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> for
the preparation of keffir:</p>

<p>"In the first, the dry brown kefir grains of
commerce are allowed to lie in water for five or
six hours until they swell; they are then carefully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>washed and placed in fresh milk, which should be
changed once or twice a day until the grains
become pure white in colour and when placed in
fresh milk, quickly mount to the surface&mdash;twenty
to thirty minutes. One litre of milk is then poured
into a flask, and a full tablespoonful of the prepared
<i>k&ouml;rner</i> added to it. This is allowed to stand
open for five to eight hours; the flask is then closed
and kept at 18&deg; C. It should be shaken every two
hours. At the end of twenty-four hours the milk
is poured through a fine sieve into another flask,
which must not be more than four fifths full. This
is corked and allowed to stand, being shaken from
time to time. At the end of twenty-four hours a
drink is obtained which contains but little carbon-dioxide
or alcohol. Usually it is not drunk until
the second day, when, upon standing, two layers are
formed, the lower milky, translucent; and the
upper containing fine flakes of casein. When
shaken it has a cream-like consistence. On the
third day it again becomes thin and very acid.
The second method is used when one has a good
kefir and two or three days to start with. Three
or four parts of fresh cows' milk are added to one
part of this and poured into flasks which are allowed
to stand for forty-eight hours with occasional
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
shaking. When the drink is ready for use, a
portion (one fifth to one third) is left in the flask
as ferment for a fresh quantity of milk. The
temperature should be maintained at about 18&deg;
C., but at the commencement a higher temperature
is desirable. The grains should be carefully
cleaned from time to time and broken up to the
size of peas. The clean grains may be dried upon
blotting-paper, in the sun, or in the vicinity of a
stove; when dried in the air they retain their
power to germinate for a long time."</p>

<p><i>Leben.</i>&mdash;In our earlier references to fermented
milks in scriptural times, we observed that alcoholic
fermented milks were not permitted to be presented
at the altar. Such offerings, however, were quite
allowable amongst the ancient Egyptians, the
Arabs and Carthaginians,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> and from remote antiquity
these nations placed great value on this
product. Leben, which is peculiarly associated
with Egypt, is a soured milk prepared from the
milk of buffaloes, cows, or goats. It is usually
prepared by the boiling of the fresh milk over a slow
fire, after which some fermented milk from a
previous preparation is added to the warm article,
and the fermentation takes place rapidly and is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
considered to be complete in about six hours.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
The Egyptian leben is valued so highly that it is
offered in hospitality to the passing stranger, and
it is regarded as so much of a duty to present this
milk, that in some parts of Arabia it would be
looked upon as scandalous if any payment were
received in return.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p><i>Matzoon.</i>&mdash;Matzoon is prepared in Armenia in
somewhat the same manner as keffir is prepared in
the Caucasus, and indeed it differs very slightly
from keffir in composition. Its use is universal in
Armenia.</p>

<p><i>Dadhi.</i>&mdash;In India large quantities of fermented
milk are used, under the name of Dadhi, and its
characteristics are not unlike the similar products
in Europe. The specific bacillus has been investigated
by Chatterjee,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> who concludes that it is
somewhat akin to the <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> and the
bacillus of leben (<i>B. lebenis</i>). Dr. Chatterjee
gives a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of his investigations which sums
up the whole matter thus:</p>

<p>"1. The fermented milk of India called Dadhi
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
resembles in all essential points the Bulgarian fermented
milk as well as the leben and other forms
of fermented milk in use in the East.</p>

<p>"2. The causative element of the curdling
process of Dadhi is a streptothrix having characters
similar to the <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> and <i>Streptobacilli
lebeni</i>, and <i>Bacillus caucasina</i> and the Long Bacilli
of Mazun, in (1) not growing in ordinary media;
(2) producing a large amount of lactic acid in milk;
(3) producing, besides coagulation of casein and
splitting up the sugar of milk into lactic acid, no
other change in milk; (4) not producing any indol,
nor peptone, nor saponification of fat, nor formation
of any gas.</p>

<p>"3. It differs from the above by showing
peculiar pink-stained granules, when stained with
methylene blue and showing peculiarly convoluted
chains in glucose agar.</p>

<p>"4. The importance of the organism lies in the
fact that, as in the case of <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i>, it
kills all pathogenic non-sporing germs and also
destroys all proteolytic gas-forming bacilli in
milk."</p>

<p>In the account of these investigations the following
table is given, showing the amount of lactic
acid produced by different lactic acid bacilli in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
one litre of milk, in terms of lactic acid&mdash;the culture
being kept at 37&deg; C.</p>

<p>In different parts of the world sour milk is
consumed in great quantities, and it is stated by
Metchnikoff<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> that the chief food of the natives
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>of tropical Africa consists of soured milk, and in
Western Africa in the region south of Angola, the
natives live almost entirely on this product, there
being a difference in the curdled milks produced
according to the nature of the microbial flora
which is introduced.</p>


<p>It is stated<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> that in Servia, Bulgaria,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> and Roumania
there were 5000 centenarians living in 1896,
and while many reasons are advanced for such
an abnormal condition of affairs, it seems fairly
certain that the sole reason why people in these
districts live to such great ages is because of their
mode of living and the fact that they live very
largely on soured milk. The hygienic conditions
throughout these countries are not such as would
give the population in the towns and villages any
special advantages in the prolongation of life, and
while it may be stated that a pastoral and agricultural
life are likely to contribute to longevity,
these conditions would not account for a general
tendency to live long in the countries referred to,
more than in any other agricultural area. There
are many countries throughout the world in which
the pastoral and agricultural existence is general,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>but it has not been shown that in these countries
life is prolonged. Hence the conclusion has been
forced upon investigators that the reason is to be
found not in the pastoral conditions, but in the
habit which has existed from time immemorial of
consuming sour milk as a principal article of diet.</p>

<p>There is no curtailment of the use of fermented
milks in Eastern Europe, and the methods of preparation
at the present day are those which have
been carried out from time immemorial. A local
observer states that in Bulgaria yoghourt is made
in nearly every household, especially in the spring
and summer. The method of preparation is very
simple: The milk is boiled until a quarter of its
volume has evaporated, it is then cooled to 45&deg; C.
and the ferment added. This ferment is a portion
of the yoghourt of good flavour and is called
"Maya" or "Zakvaska." The vases, a kind of
earthenware pot, are enveloped in woollen stuff or
sheepskin and placed in a warm place near the
chimney. In ten hours the yoghourt is made, and
it is preserved in a cold place. The great reputation
that the yoghourt has acquired in Western
Europe has caused this "Maya" to become an
article of commerce. It is sent out by rail hermetically
sealed in tinplate boxes. According to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
a Sophia chemist, the "Maya" is employed in
the following manner: For a litre of milk it is
necessary to take about 10 gr. of the ferment.
This ferment is diluted with three times the
amount of water and put into a bowl previously
heated with hot water and dried. Into this bowl
the milk, previously boiled and cooled to a temperature
of 75&deg; to 50&deg; C., is poured; it is then
covered over and put in a temperature of about
30&deg; C., and, in default of a stove of constant
temperature, the bowl is wrapped round with
flannel or a plaid, and left to curdle for eight to
ten hours. It is then ready for consumption.
During winter, curdled milk keeps for several
days, and in summer it becomes sour in from twelve
to twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>A similar food to the yoghourt is prepared in the
Balkan mountains from sheep's milk under the
name of "Urgoutnik."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> The milk is poured into a
goatskin or sheepskin bag, and a little of the fermented
milk added, and is then left for some hours
in a warm place. The milk consumed is replaced
by a fresh supply. In some of the Balkan countries,
they are not content with the fermentation of the
milk, they add a little alum, which, under the name
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
of "typsa," is well known for this purpose. The
milk attains such a solid consistency that it can
be put into a cloth and carried to market.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p>The various forms of sour milk which have
been described in the foregoing pages may be said
to be of the traditional kind, and with the light
of modern knowledge, it has been possible to determine
exactly what constitutes the active principle
in use in the milk consumed in these countries,
and, as we shall see, this principle has been applied
so that, at the present day, a pure fermented
milk may be obtained in any country, and there
is every reason to believe that should such be
adopted as a general article of food, it would contribute
to the prolongation of human existence.</p>

<p>It is due to Metchnikoff, of the Pasteur Institute,
that so much prominence has been given to the
use of fermented milks. He gave it as his opinion<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
that senility was caused partly by auto-intoxication
or by the poison derived from putrefactive
micro-organisms which inhabit the digestive track.
These organisms increase with age, and under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>certain unhealthy conditions multiply enormously,
particularly in the large intestine. Having arrived
at this knowledge, Metchnikoff set to work to
devise some means of combating the influence of
these harmful microbes, and set up the hypothesis
that the tendency to longevity which is exhibited
in Eastern countries is due to the consumption of
lactic acid organisms in the shape of soured milk.
These organisms are more powerful than those of
a putrefactive character and inhibit their growth.</p>

<p>"In the presence of such facts," says Metchnikoff,
"it becomes exceedingly important to
find some means of combating the intestinal putrefaction
which constitutes so incontestable a source
of danger. Such putrefaction is not only capable
of producing diseases of the digestive tube&mdash;<i>enteritis</i>
and <i>colitis</i>&mdash;but even of becoming a source
of intoxication of the organism in its most varied
manifestations.</p>

<p>"It is some years since I proposed to combat
intestinal putrefaction and its injurious consequences
by means of lactic ferments. I thought
the acidity produced by such microbes would
be much more effective in preventing the germination
of putrefying microbes than the small quantity
of acids produced by <i>Bacillus coli</i>. On the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
hand, I had no illusion as to the difficulty sure
to be encountered in any effort to introduce lactic
microbes into the intestinal flora which has been
preoccupied by a multitude of other microbes.
To make surer of the result, I chose the lactic
microbe, which is the strongest as an acid producer.
It is found in the <i>yahourt</i> (yoghourt),
which originates in Bulgaria. The same bacillus
has also been isolated from the <i>leben</i> of Egypt; and
it is now proved that it is found in the curdled milk
of the whole Balkan peninsula, and even in the
Don region of Russia."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p>It is a short step from considerations like these
to the adoption of the <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> as the
most potent of the various lactic organisms which
have been examined, and which is likely to play
such an important r&ocirc;le in the destiny of the human
race. The <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> may claim to be
the Bacillus of Long Life.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER III</h4>

<h5>THE CHEMISTRY OF MILK</h5>


<p><i>The Composition of Milk.</i>&mdash;Like all other organic
substances, or those built up in connection
with the life processes of plants and animals, milk
is of complex composition. It is also very liable
to change&mdash;every one is acquainted with its
tendency to "go bad." This instability is more or
less inherent in all highly organised chemical compounds,
and, indeed, it seems to be necessary that
the materials used in growth and nutrition should
be very plastic in a chemical sense, in order, <i>e.g.</i>,
that the constituents, say of a plant, may easily
be transformed into the substances of the body
of the animal which feeds on it.</p>

<p>The perishable nature of milk&mdash;the food of
young and growing animals&mdash;is therefore essential,
so that it may be changed easily into the blood,
bone, muscle, etc., so abundantly required in the
early stages of existence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Milk is a complete food, and, therefore, naturally
it is not a simple chemical compound, but a mechanical
mixture of a number of substances. The
present state of chemical knowledge on the subject
does not permit of its composition being given
in detail, but for practical purposes, such as those of
measuring its purity and food value, this is not
necessary.</p>

<p>A proximate analysis, in which, at least, some of
the ingredients are lumped together, is sufficient,
and has been adopted everywhere by analysts.
On this basis the average composition of cows'
milk may be stated as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">In the illustration, a pint of milk is shown in a glass jar, and the various percentages of water, casein, sugar, ash,
albumen, and fat, which make up its constituent parts, are shown in separate bottles, the percentage of each

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>Milk varies a good deal in composition; the different
breeds of cows give varying qualities. The Short-horn
gives large quantities of milk of rather poor
analysis, while the Jersey yields smaller proportions
of very rich milk. During the period of
lactation (the time which has elapsed since the
cow gave birth to a calf), care in milking, food,
health, etc., all have an effect on the quality of
the milk.</p>

<p>The limits of variation may be stated as
follows:</p>

<p>These figures are extreme, and it is very seldom
indeed that either the minimum or maximum is
reached. Indeed, by the regulation laid down under
Clause 4 of the British Sale of Food and Drugs
Act of 1899, when the percentage of solids not fat
falls below 8.5 per cent., and fat under 3 per cent.,
it is assumed that the milk has been adulterated.
This regulation is a perfectly just one. While
genuine milk may, in rare instances, show figures as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
low as 7.1 per cent. of solids not fat, or 2.5 per cent.
of fat, the right can hardly be claimed of supplying
such an abnormal article to the public as milk
of proper quality, and the dairyman who understands
his business, and wishes to deal fairly with
his customers, can, by attention to the conditions
enumerated above which influence the composition
of milk, entirely avoid the production of such a
low-grade article.</p>

<p>In the nutrition of both plants and animals
large quantities of water are needed. The solids
must be supplied in solution or dissolved in the
assimilative processes, and this cannot take place
without water, which also conveys the dissolved
solids to the various parts of the economy, and in
the case of animals removes waste materials. For
the most part, water passes through the body
unchanged, but a certain proportion unites chemically
with the food materials and assists in their
digestion. It is therefore not surprising that
seven eighths of milk is composed of water. Blood
contains a similar proportion, and this agreement
emphasises the fact that milk is a perfectly balanced
food.</p>

<p>The fat of milk, which yields cream and butter,
differs in some important respects from other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
fats. Like these, it is made up chiefly of stearin,
palmitin, and olein, but, in addition, it contains
an abnormally large proportion of compounds of
certain of the volatile fatty acids. It is these
which give to butter its agreeable flavour. By the
methods of Duclaux, the following is the approximate
composition of butter fat:</p>

</table>

<p>Myristin occurs in nutmegs; butyrin in another
combination flavours pineapples and rum; caprinin
is found in cocoanut fat, mutton fat, and in the
offensive odour given off by the goat (from which
the name is derived); caprylin is a by-product of
alcoholic fermentation, and also occurs in cocoa
fat; laurin is found in sweet bay; from which it
is evident that there are some curious relationships
in flavouring materials.</p>

<p>Fats are very concentrated foods, furnishing a
large amount of energy to the body. At one time
they were classed together with starch, sugar, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
other carbohydrates as heat-producers, but the
distinction which was drawn between the kinds
of food which were thought solely to keep up the
temperature of the organism, and those which
produced force in work and other forms of bodily
energy, has broken down, and by direct experiment
has been found not to exist. It is usually calculated
that one part of fat is equal in food value
to about two and a quarter parts of any of
the other carbohydrates. Milk fat or butter is
more digestible than almost any other fat, and its
importance therefore can readily be realised. All
the above constituents of milk fat are composed of
different proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, but milk also contains minute quantities
of lecithin, a fat containing phosphorus in addition.
Lecithin is also found in the brain and nerve
material of animals, in the yolk of egg, and in
several plants.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous constituents of milk&mdash;casein
and albumen&mdash;are usually estimated together,
and they are reckoned as of equivalent food value.
The name protein is very commonly applied to
the total of these bodies in milk, or other animal
and vegetable foods. They are composed of different
proportions of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and nitrogen, with small quantities of sulphur,
while casein contains phosphorus in addition.
Albumen exists to the extent of about 0.6 per cent.
in milk. It is very similar in properties to egg
albumen. The coagulum which forms on the
surface of milk when boiled is largely composed of
albumen. Casein is combined with, and kept in
solution by, lime, soda, and calcium phosphate, and
its amount averages a little over 3 per cent.</p>

<p>The remarkable property possessed by rennet,
of curdling or coagulating casein, is well known;
rennet is an extract from the stomach of the calf,
and similar principles are present in the stomachs
of man and other animals, so that the coagulation
of milk is the first process in its digestion. If
milk is gulped down in large quantities it is apt
to coagulate in lumps, and digestion is much interfered
with, but if it is taken hot and slowly,
it coagulates in small pieces which are readily
attacked by the gastric juice, and milk is then one
of the most assimilable of foods.</p>

<p>Nature provides that the milk for young animals
is supplied in finely divided streams, so that coagulation
takes place in the best possible way.</p>

<p>The proteids are the most important constituents
of food; they are abundant in the blood,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
and build up the muscles, brain, nerves, and other
bodily structures.</p>

<p>Besides these mentioned, milk contains traces
of another proteid of similar composition called
globulin.</p>

<p>The sugar of milk is not found anywhere else.
It is a carbohydrate like cane and grape sugar&mdash;that
is to say, the hydrogen and oxygen they contain
are in the same relative proportions as in
water. Milk sugar is not so soluble or so sweet
as the other sugars. It does not ferment with
ordinary yeast, but certain special yeasts which
are made use of in the preparation of keffir,
koumiss, etc., have the power of transforming it
into alcohol. Its most remarkable property, however,
is the facility with which, under the influence
of certain bacteria, it is changed into lactic acid.</p>

<p>Every one is familiar with the souring of milk,
but perhaps it is not so generally known that there
are great differences in the results obtained in
accordance with the conditions under which the
souring takes place. The skilled butter-maker,
by keeping the milk in a cool and cleanly dairy,
obtains a sour milk of a characteristic and agreeable
aroma and taste, which beneficially affect the
flavour of the butter produced. On the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
hand, if milk is kept in hot and dirty surroundings,
the development of acidity is accompanied by
different bad tastes and odours, and it becomes
unfit for use as a food. In the first case, the
conditions are favourable to the maximum production
of the lactic acid bacteria, and these
occupy the field, and largely prevent the development
of the other bacteria which are present&mdash;the
survival of the fittest in the struggle for existence.
In the second case, the impure surroundings
swarm with the germs of many kinds of putrefactive
bacteria, and the high temperature assists
these to gain the upper hand. Again, the survival
of the fittest, in the particular conditions. Even
in cool and cleanly surroundings injurious taints
may develop, especially if the milk has previously
been subjected to a journey by road or rail, as is
the case in the modern creamery system, where
the farmers deliver their milk to a central creamery,
where it is made into butter. In such establishments
it is the regular practice to kill the germs,
lactic and others, existing in the milk, by heating
it to a high temperature. This process is called
pasteurising, after the great French chemist and
bacteriologist who invented it. Pure lactic cultures
are added to the pasteurised milk, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
souring process is under exact control, with the
result that butter of uniform flavour and quality
is produced. The same method is made use of in
making the special sour milk described in this
book, with, of course, modifications in the apparatus
employed, to suit the smaller scale in which
the manufacture is conducted.</p>

<p>The ash is the mineral matter which is left
when milk, previously dried, is burnt in a crucible.
It is a complex mixture, and, as we have seen,
it amounts to about 0.7 per cent. of the milk.
The process of burning destroys all the organic
matter, and, at the same time, alters somewhat
the state of combination of the inorganic or mineral
elements. Attempts have been made from the
analysis of the ash to reconstitute the composition
of the mineral matter as it exists in the milk.
The best known is that of Soldner, and the following

<p>The presence of citrates will be noted in this
analysis. Citric acid, which gives to lemons their
acidity, and is also found in other fruits, has been
proved to exist in milk to the extent of about
0.2 per cent. When alkaline or earthy citrates
are burnt or oxidised in the blood, the citric acid
is destroyed, and corresponding carbonates remain.
No doubt the function of citrates in milk is to
furnish to the body the earthy and alkaline carbonates
which are required in certain of its parts.</p>

<p>The mineral constituents of milk have many
important functions to perform in the building
up and nutrition of the bodily organism. Phosphate
of lime is the principal constituent of the
skeleton, and the blood must be richly supplied
with the alkalies, earths, and acids which are
comprehended in the ash.</p>

<p>Milk contains traces of many other substances,
the most important of which are several enzymes
which assist in its digestion.</p>

<p><i>General Properties of Milk.</i>&mdash;The appearance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
of milk is known to every one; it ought to be
a pure white opaque liquid, but very generally
it is tinted a cream colour with anatto to give it
an added appearance of richness. The average
specific gravity is about 1.031; or, to put it another
way, while a gallon of pure water weighs exactly
10 lbs., a gallon of milk weighs 10 lbs. 5 oz. It
freezes at 31&deg; F. and boils at about one third of
a degree higher than water.</p>

<p>When milk is examined under the microscope,
the fat is found to be distributed through it in a
multitude of minute globules varying in size from
1/16,000th to 1/25,000th part of an inch, and occasionally
they are much smaller and also much larger.</p>

<p>Fig. 1 is a micro-photograph showing the fat
globules in whole milk. Fig. 2 is a micro-photograph
of separated milk, and Fig. 3 a micro-photograph
of cream, all under high magnification (450

of fat globules present may be seen.</p>

of Cream, showing agglomeration
of fat globules. (Magnified

<p>Fats distributed through a watery liquid in this
finely divided condition form together what is
called an emulsion, in which the particles of fat
are kept apart by surface tension. The specific
gravity of milk fat averages 0.93, and compared
with water weighing 10 lbs., a gallon of fat would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>weigh 9 lbs. 5 oz. It is thus considerably lighter
than the other constituents, and when milk is left
at rest, the fat globules gradually rise to the top
and float there, forming cream. The difference in
specific gravity between cream and milk is taken
advantage of in the mechanical separator, now so
much used, and which makes such a thorough
separation between the two. Cream is an article
of the most varied composition, according to the
ideas of the person who produces it, but it ought
to contain at least 20 per cent. of butter fat, and
may be made with a much larger percentage if
necessary. When cream is agitated in a particular
way, as by churning, the surface tension of the
particles is overcome, and they run together into
a mass which forms butter.</p>

<p>The casein of milk is not held in solution in
the ordinary sense, but in a peculiar state of
suspension called the colloidal condition, practically
the whole of it remaining behind when milk
is filtered through clay filters.</p>

<p>It is this state of suspension of the casein which
makes milk opaque, but the opacity is considerably
increased by the emulsified fat.</p>

<p>The coagulation of the casein in milk by the
addition of rennet has already been referred to.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Acids, either mineral or organic, also precipitate it
in the form of flakes. Skimmed milk is now largely
used for the preparation of casein by this method,
and the washed and dried precipitate is used very
extensively in the arts for such varied purposes as the
manufacture of billiard balls, paints, cements, etc.</p>

<p>The clear liquid which separates when milk is
curdled with rennet is called whey, and contains
the milk sugar and mineral salts. The sugar is
manufactured from it on a limited scale, and is
used as an ingredient in infant foods, and as a
convenient medium in certain medical preparations.
In Sweden a kind of cheese is made from
whey, but the great bulk of it everywhere is used
for feeding pigs.</p>

of milk is given in the following table:<br /><br /></p>

<p class="cap"><br /><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 4 is a photograph of two Petri
dishes, which have been inoculated with ordinary milk (A), and milk that
has been subjected to sterilisation (B). The whitish bacterial colonies
on A are due to enormous numbers of organisms, while B is quite free
from such growth.<br /><br />

For the production of a reliable lactic food, it is essential that
certain precautions as to the treatment of the milk, and the maintenance
of a suitable temperature during the growth of the lactic
bacteria, should be observed.<br /><br />

In the first place, milk immediately after extraction from the
cow contains only a few organisms, but these multiply so rapidly
that in a few hours the bacterial content may amount to many
millions per ounce. In preparing a pure culture of any specific
organism, then, care must be taken to destroy all the bacteria that
have accidentally found their way into the milk, inoculating with
the organisms it is desired to cultivate. This is best accomplished
by heating the milk to the boiling-point of water for about thirty
minutes, by which time almost all the undesirable bacteria have
been killed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>The milk of the cow differs a good deal from
human milk, and where the former is used for the
feeding of children it is usual to add milk sugar
to it, and otherwise alter it to bring its composition
more in harmony with the human article. The
high concentration of the milk of the reindeer and
the whale is noteworthy. Perhaps this may be
due to the low temperature conditions in which
these animals live, necessitating strong nutriment
to enable their young to make proper progress in
growth and development. On the other hand,
the milk of the ass is poor in quality, and probably
on this account it is more readily assimilated by
those of weak digestion, to whom it is sometimes
recommended. Goats' milk is richer than either
cow or human milk, and its nourishing properties
are well known. The goat is usually free from
tuberculosis and other diseases which affect the
cow, and its milk is therefore a very safe article
to use.</p>

<p><i>The Analysis of Milk.</i>&mdash;While the analysis of
milk can only be made by a competent chemist,
there are a number of simple tests and observations
by which any intelligent person can obtain

<span class="figleft" style="width: 75px;"><a name="fig5" id="fig5"></a><img src="images/fig5.jpg" width="75" height="195" alt=
"The Creamometer" title="" />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;5.
The Creamometer</span></span>

a fair idea of its quality. The taste and smell
afford some guide, as also the general appearance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
To judge of the latter, place some of the milk in a
tumbler or other clear glass vessel. If the milk
is of good quality it will be quite homogeneous
and opaque. Any flocculent matter indicates
either disease in the cow or that the milk is old
and bacteria have multiplied in it and altered its
composition. When the milk has stood
long enough for the cream to rise freely,
the latter should form a perfectly homogeneous
and strongly defined layer on the
top. The quantity of cream may be
measured in a creamometer, which consists
of a small glass cylinder graduated
at the top (Fig. 5). It is filled with
milk to the top graduation line, and when
the cream has risen, the percentage quantity of
the latter which has separated can be taken off.</p>

<p>The colour should be like that of porcelain,
but, as already stated, it is a common thing for
the dairyman to add a small quantity of anatto
or an aniline dye of a similar shade, to give the
milk a rich creamy tint. If the milk is of a reddish
colour this may be caused by blood from the udder,
although certain foods, such as beets, mangels,
and carrots sometimes give a similar tint. The
milk given by cows immediately after calving is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>called "colostrum" or "biestings," and is of a
yellow or yellow-brown colour. It is much thicker
than ordinary milk, and coagulates in boiling.</p>

<p>In dirty byres in which care is not taken in
milking, quite considerable quantities of hairs,
pieces of manure, and other filth may get into the
milk. Usually the milk is strained by the dairyman,
but sometimes this is omitted or carelessly
done. To test for dirt, a ribbed glass funnel is
useful. Get a piece of the finest muslin about
twice the diameter of the funnel, fold over twice,
so that it becomes one quarter of its original size;
open one of the sections and place in the funnel;
pass the milk into this. It will run through
quickly and some water may be run into the
funnel to clear away the last traces of milk. The
filter cloth can then be opened out and any dirt
retained will become visible. The apparatus is
shown in Fig. 6.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Testing-Glass for Extraneous Matter in Milk.</span></p>

<p class="indent2"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 6.&mdash;A piece of muslin is folded as shown and a measured quantity of milk
is passed through the funnel; from the sediment left in the muslin, the
percentage of extraneous matter may be arrived at.</p></div>


<p>If a glass funnel is not available, a very small
jelly bag can be made of fine gauze and used in
the same way. The washing water should be
used in small quantities and directed to concentrating
the dirt in the apex of the bag. After
washing, the latter can be turned outside in, to
permit of readier examination of the dirt. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
bag should be well washed in cold water, then
boiled and dried, and is then ready for future
use.</p>

<p>The acidity of milk is a very useful guide to
its age. Milk has the curious property of being
"amphoteric," <i>i.e.</i>, it is both slightly acid and
slightly alkaline when fresh. As its age increases,
however, so does its acidity, and at a rate varying
with the temperature and moisture contents of the
atmosphere in which it is placed. Old and acid
milk is heavily contaminated with bacteria, a proportion
of which are likely to be injurious to health.</p>

<p>The simplest method of testing the acidity is to
procure a few little books of blue and red litmus

<span class="figleft" style="width: 125px;"><a name="fig7" id="fig7"></a><img src="images/fig7.jpg" width="125" height="233" alt=
"Lactometer and Test Tube" title="" />
<span class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span>&nbsp;7. Lactometer
and Test Tube</span></span>

test papers, and these can be had
from any philosophical instrument
maker or laboratory furnisher. The
strips of test paper are torn out
and dipped in the milk. When the
milk is quite fresh it will, owing
to its amphoteric condition, change
the red litmus paper slightly blue,
and the blue litmus paper slightly
red. Old milk changes blue litmus
paper to a bright red because of its
decided acidity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>The above tests do not indicate if the milk is
poor or rich, but this can be determined by the
lactometer, an instrument for ascertaining in a
simple way the specific gravity. The lactometer
is shown in Fig. 7.</p>

<p>It is graduated usually from 25&deg; to 36&deg;, corresponding
to specific gravities 1.029 to 1.038. It is
graduated to degrees and half degrees. Sometimes
a thermometer is combined with the instrument.
The specific gravity rises as the temperature is
lowered and decreases with increase of temperature,
so that it is important to make the test at the
figure at which the lactometer was graduated,
which is usually 60&deg; F. Failing this, an allowance
has to be made for higher or lower temperatures.
The milk to be tested is well mixed, and placed
in a deep vessel, and the lactometer placed in it,
holding it at first at an angle. It stands upright
and remains deeper or higher according to the
specific gravity. The reading is taken on the stem
at the level of the milk. As the latter is drawn up
a little round the stem, about a half degree should
be added on to get the true figure. Thus, if the
apparent reading is 31, the true reading may be
taken as 31.5. This is the average figure for good
milk, corresponding to a specific gravity of 1.0315;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
anything above this is all to the good. Lower
readings mean inferior quality, the latter being
proportionate to the lowness of the readings.
The tests are most conveniently made in a glass
cylinder (Fig. 7), which may be purchased with
the lactometer. As there are many inaccurate
instruments in the market, it is necessary to go to
a reputable maker, because an unreliable lactometer
is worse than useless.</p>

<p>The following table gives, in a condensed
form, the allowances to be made when the temperature
is above or below the standard (60&deg; F.):</p>

can readily be averaged. Care should be taken
to wash the lactometer with cold water under the
tap, as otherwise the milk will dry on it and render
it inaccurate.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IV</h4>

<h5>HANDLING OF MILK</h5>


<h6>MODERN DAIRY PRACTICE</h6>

<p>As we have seen, the dairy industry is a very
ancient one, and has been intimately associated
with the development of civilisation.</p>

<p>Within historical times dairying has always
formed a prominent feature in connection with
agriculture, and the use of milk in one form or
another has been common to every civilised
nation.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>The greatest progress, however, in the study
of milk has taken place since about the year 1890,
at which time the dairy industry seems to have
attracted the general attention of food specialists
and scientific investigators throughout the world.
Since then it has been considered worth while
to enact laws in different countries with regard
to the regulation and control of the milk supply.</p>

<p>Since 1903 there has been an International
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>Dairy Federation formed, and it has held conferences
at Brussels, Paris, The Hague, and Buda-Pest,
and in 1911 it will hold a conference in
Stockholm. The Federation was started in a
very humble way in Brussels, and owes its origin,
to a large extent, to a distinguished Belgian agriculturist,
Baron Peers of Oostcamp, Bruges; but
at the present day a general committee composed
of representatives of nearly every civilised nation
has been formed, and delegates from such countries
attend the Congresses, which are held every
two years. The literature which has arisen out
of these International Congresses has been disseminated
in different countries, and has been
instrumental in placing the dairy industry on a
thoroughly scientific basis.</p>


<p><i>Milk Supply of the United Kingdom.</i>&mdash;The
milk supply of the United Kingdom has steadily
grown from year to year, and in relation to the
population works out at fifteen gallons per head.
The manner in which these figures are arrived at
is shown in the following estimate:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The population of the United Kingdom is now about
45,500,000. The number of cows or heifers in calf or in
milk in June, 1909, was 3,360,600; the number in 1910
was probably about 4,400,000.<br /><br />

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Of these about 300,000 were heifers that had not yet
produced any milk. The actual milking class, therefore,
comprised about 4,100,000 cows and heifers; of these,
about 600,000 were heifers that calved in the winter
and spring of 1909-10, and 300,000 were heifers that calved
in the summer and autumn of 1910. The number of cows
that produced two or more calves may be taken to be about
3,200,000; of these about 600,000 should have produced
their second calf in the winter and spring 1909-10, and
would be milked as heifers in the summer and autumn of
1910; the number of mature cows from which a full season's
supply of milk was obtained during the twelve months
from June 5, 1909, to June 4, 1910, was apparently about
2,600,000. A large quantity of milk is yielded during the
year by cows sold or lost during the twelve months before
the census. Possibly ten per cent. of the milk produced
in the twelve months from June, 1909, to June, 1910, was
yielded by cows that were sold or lost before the census
of June, 1910.<br /><br />

It is estimated that the 3,200,000 cows (including the
600,000 that up to the winter of 1909-10 were heifers)
produced, on the average, 44 cwts. (480 gallons) of milk
per head in the twelve months from June 5, 1909, to June
4, 1910; the 300,000 heifers that calved in the summer and
autumn, 30 cwts. (330 gallons) per head; the 600,000
heifers that calved in the winter and spring of 1909-10,
15 cwts. (165 gallons), making the total quantity of milk
produced in the twelve months by cows and heifers on
the farms, and that produced calves during the twelve
months (June, 1909-1910), 158,800,000 cwts. (1,746,800,000
gallons), or about 426 gallons per head, and about 400
gallons per head for all the cows and heifers in milk or in
calf in 1910. There remains to add the milk yielded by the
cows that were sold during the twelve months, and of cows
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
and heifers in feeding pastures that were milked during
the twelve months, June to June, 1909-10, and which
probably formed one tenth of the whole supply, making
the total supply for the twelve months 176,444,000 cwts.,
or 1,940,884,000 gallons. This equals 2 tons, or 440 gallons
per head, crediting the whole supply to the 4,400,000
cows and heifers in milk or in calf in June, 1910. At 7-1/4d.
per gallon the value of milk produced in the United Kingdom
in the twelve months was &pound;58,600,000. Including
the value at birth of the calves, the total value of the produce
of the milk-giving class would be about &pound;62,000,000.
The value of the milk, butter, cheese, and cream sold
or consumed in farmhouses would be about &pound;48,000,000,
or equal to about 24 per cent. of the gross annual income
of farmers.<br /><br />

The average consumption of new milk is about 15 gallons
per head of the population. During the twelve months
of 1911, the quantity required for this purpose will be about
682,500,000 gallons, or about 35 per cent. of the total
supply; calves will require about 10 per cent. of the supply;
the quantity available for butter and cheese will equal
about 55 per cent. of the supply.
<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p></div>

<p><i>The Milk Industry in the United States.</i>&mdash;In the
United States of America, where the habits of
the people are somewhat analogous to those in
the United Kingdom, it is estimated that the
milk from five million cows is annually consumed,
which averages twenty-five and one half gallons
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>per year for each person, or equal to an ordinary
sized tumblerful each day.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>


<p>Such a vast industry, so intimately associated
with the food of the bulk of the people, naturally
invites the closest study, and, as a consequence,
the literature on the subject, which has arisen
during the last twenty years, has been of a voluminous
character, not only from the point of view
of practice, but from that of bacteriology, chemistry,
and hygiene.</p>

<p>A pure milk supply is essential to health, and
it seems unfortunate that the ordinary milk producer
should, in a great many cases, take up an
antagonistic attitude to the scientific methods of
handling milk. There is a body of opinion being
created, however, which is likely to alter this
attitude in the next generation, and this is attributable
to the fact that so much excellent work
has been done at numerous dairy colleges and
institutes in all civilised countries that the dairy
industry is emerging from a period of rule-of-thumb
procedure to its proper place as one of the
technical arts.</p>

<p><i>Transmission of Disease in Milk.</i>&mdash;It is not to
be wondered at that the handling of milk should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>now be regarded as a technical business, seeing
that milk-borne disease is one of the commonest
with which we have to deal.</p>

<p>The commoner diseases which have been transmitted
by milk are scarlet fever, typhoid, diphtheria,
tuberculosis, sore throat epidemics. Others
of a more complex character have been traced to
the same source of infection, and the clearest
possible evidence has been furnished of the transmission
of diseases by means of micro-organisms,
which have contaminated the milk supply.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary to watch over the milk
from the source of supply to its consumption.
It is primarily on the farm and in the cow-house
that methods of handling in a hygienic way should
be insisted on, as microbial contamination increases
at a prodigious rate, and it is the early
microbe therefore which does the most damage.</p>

<p>The milk in the udder, for all practical purposes,
may be assumed to be sterile, and the contamination
which takes place originates, therefore,
from external sources.</p>

<p>One of the principal means of infection is from
hairs which fall from the cow into the milk, and
many of which are carriers of dangerous micro-organisms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
There is also a certain amount of offensive
dirty matter which may fall into the milk-pail,
and carry with it undesirable germs.</p>

<p>These impurities may, to a certain extent, be
eliminated by good straining, but a surer prevention
is to have the cow-house perfectly clean
and free from dust, as dust specks are in many
cases the vehicles of disease germs. Cleanliness
is, in fact, the essential feature in modern dairying,
not only in the cow-house, but in the milking
utensils, the drainage, etc., and, above all, the
milker should be of cleanly habits.</p>

<p>The flavours of milk sometimes arise from the
absorption of evil-smelling gases in the cow-house,
or from a peculiar taint from certain roots
and feeding stuffs, and in such a case it is desirable
that a&euml;ration should take place in a fresh clear
atmosphere, so that oxygenation may have the
effect of eliminating and destroying the foreign
odours and flavours which may be present. If
this process of a&euml;ration is carried out at blood
heat, the result is generally highly satisfactory.</p>

<p><i>Milk Management.</i>&mdash;There have been many
excellent tables of rules published for the management
of dairies in different countries, but they are
necessarily framed within certain limitations which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
apply to all. The following is an excellent set,
which put concisely the conditions necessary to
be observed in the modern cow-house:</p>

<div class="blockquot3"><p class="indent4">1. The cow should be sound&mdash;no disease should exist in the
animal.</p>

<p class="indent4">2. The feed should be good and free from aromatic substances.
If these aromatic foods are used, they should be employed
according to those methods which will not cause odours or
flavours to appear in the milk.</p>

<p class="indent4">3. The cow should be groomed, and hair about the udder preferably
clipped.</p>

<p class="indent4">4. The udder should be moistened during milking.</p>

<p class="indent4">5. The milker should be a neat, tidy person.</p>

<p class="indent4">6. The milker should be free from disease, and should not come
in contact with any communicable disease.</p>

<p class="indent4">7. The milker's clothes and hands should be clean while milking.</p>

<p class="indent4">8. The pail should be sterilised.</p>

<p class="indent4">9. The stall should be such as to reduce the amount of disturbance
of dust and dirt.</p>

<p class="indent4">10. There should be good light, good ventilation, and good
drainage in the cow-house.</p>

<p class="indent4">11. The cow-house should always be kept clean.</p>

<p class="indent4">12. Feeding and bedding, unless moist, should be done after
milking.</p>

<p class="indent4">13. A dustless milking-room is desirable.</p>

<p class="indent4">14. Milk should not stand in the cow-house.</p>

<p class="indent4">15. If milk is a&euml;rated, it should be done before cooling and in
pure air.</p>

<p class="indent4">16. The sooner the milk is cooled after milking the better.</p>

<p class="indent4">17. Keep the milk as cold as possible when once cooled.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p></div>

<p>The supply of milk is conducted, to a large
extent, by towns' dairies, which depend for their
supplies upon the dairy farm in the country, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>it is obvious that a certain period of time must
elapse, in the generality of cases, before a town's
dairy receives its supply in the ordinary course,
and this constitutes the greatest difficulty in
modern dairy practice, owing to the liability of
the milk to absorb bacteria, which during transit
may multiply enormously.</p>

<p>The multiplying of bacteria in milk at different
temperatures is easily demonstrated, and the
result of this has been stated in various forms
many times over. As a graphic means, however,
of showing the increase that takes place in the
numbers of germs present, and the consequent
product of acidity, the table below by Conn may
be given.</p>

<p>The consequent result of the increase in bacteria
is the production of lactic acid, which produces
the souring so familiar in milk which has been
kept in the household at a high temperature.</p>

<p>What actually happens is that the lactic acid is
produced by the breaking up of the milk sugar, and
the appearance of this sourness is an indication that
a period has been reached in the age of the milk
which may be described as being&mdash;unwholesome.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, for the town's milk
dairy to be equipped in such a way as to deal
promptly with the milk supply.</p>

<p>We have seen that the milk should first of all
be a&euml;rated at blood heat, so as to liberate objectionable
odours, after which it should be cooled to
as low a temperature as possible, by means of
well water. When these operations have been
performed on the farm, milk should be sent as
rapidly as possible to the distributing towns'
dairies, and should be transported in refrigerated
waggons, cooled preferably with ice, during the
journey. On arrival at the town dairy, it will
be necessary to pasteurise the milk&mdash;that is to
say, the milk should be heated to such a temperature
as will destroy any pathogenic organisms
which may be present, and the pasteurising temperature
should therefore be in excess of the
thermal death-point of all such organisms.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Pasteurisation owes its origin to Pasteur, and
has become an adopted method throughout the
dairy industry, and there are many mechanical
devices termed "pasteurisers" (see Fig. 8) which
are used for the carrying out of this particular
operation. The form of one of these is that of a
vertical jacketed cylinder with paraboloidal surface,
around which steam is made to pass, so as to
maintain the temperature at about 176&deg; F. Milk
is allowed to flow in at the bottom of the paraboloidal
surface, and is caught by mechanical
agitating arms, which revolve at a given speed,
and by this action milk is distributed centrifugally
over the paraboloidal surface, and is forced
out by the same action, at the top of the apparatus,
after being heated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig8" id="fig8"></a><img src="images/fig8.jpg" width="500" height="768" alt=
"Pasteuriser" title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pasteuriser</span></p>

<p class="indent2"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 8.&mdash;The milk enters from the bottom and circulates
to the top of the inside cylinder, which is paraboloidal
in construction. It is heated as it passes
through the apparatus, and is discharged at the top
at a temperature of 176&deg; F.</p></div>


<p>The centrifugal action is sufficient to raise the
milk some three to four feet, through a tube, and
this is taken advantage of so as to cause the milk
to flow over a conical cooler, described as a primary
cooler, and in which water is made to circulate.
As the hot milk descends over the conical cooler
it gives up most of its acquired heat to the water,
and, in practice, is reduced in temperature to within
4&deg; of the temperature of the water.</p>


<p>Below this primary cooler is fixed a cooler of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>the same size and shape, which is termed a secondary
cooler. In it, brine at a temperature of about
35&deg; F. is circulated from a refrigerating machine,
and, as the milk falls over the secondary cooler,
it is cooled to a temperature of about 40&deg; F.,
when it may be looked upon as being pasteurised
and free from all pathogenic organisms, in which
state it will keep for a considerable length of
time.</p>

<p>It is desirable that the milk should, as soon
as possible after the cooling takes place, be delivered
to the consumers, and be kept under cool
conditions, either in bottles or in a closed vessel
covered over with muslin, so as to keep out specks
of germ-laden dust.</p>

<p>Briefly speaking, the foregoing is an outline of
what is carried on in the ordinary dairy practice.</p>

<p>There are many modifications of this practice,
such as the introduction of regenerative heaters,
so as to utilise a portion of the heat of pasteurisation,
which would otherwise be wasted.</p>

<p>In some cases, again, it is considered necessary
to conduct the primary and secondary cooling
over coolers furnished with mantles, so that the
atmospheric bacteria which are everywhere present
should be shut off from the falling milk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
Ordinarily, however, the equipment for a town's
dairy consists of:</p>

<p>1. Steam-boiler to generate steam for pasteurising,
scalding, etc.</p>

<p>2. Motive power, which may be either a steam-engine,
gas-engine, or electric motor.</p>

<p>3. Refrigerating machine, which is used for
supplying cold brine to the secondary cooler.
In many cases it is also used for cooling a room in
which the milk and cream are stored.</p>

<p>4. Milk-receiving tank.</p>

<p>5. Milk-strainer.</p>

<p>6. Pasteurising apparatus, and primary and
secondary coolers.</p>

<p>Such a plant is necessary in order to conduct
an ordinary town dairy business in anything
like a hygienic way, and is designed only
for the handling of milk intended for domestic
consumption.</p>

<p>There are times when another plant might be
necessary, such as a plant for the separation of
milk, or for utilising it for the production of
butter or cheese, such operations being subject
to the fluctuations in the milk supply.</p>

<p>It is sometimes desirable also to use up an
excess of milk for cheese or butter-making; hence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
it is necessary to provide such apparatus as has
been indicated.</p>

<p><i>Preparation of Soured Milk.</i>&mdash;The foregoing
description has been given in some detail, as
showing the ordinary practice, and we now come
to consider how it can be modified so as to provide
for the production of soured milk. It may first
of all be premised that within the next few years
the preparation of soured milk as an ordinary
production of the dairy will be universal, and will
form a part of the ordinary dairy practice. The
apparatus, therefore, which is necessary is one
of considerable interest to all who are engaged in
the dairy industry.</p>

<p>As will be seen from the chapter describing
the preparation of soured milk in the dairy, this
process can be conveniently carried on, so as to
utilise the plant which is at present in general
use. The milk can be received in the same way,
pasteurised and cooled to about blood-heat, after
which its preparation as soured milk is a very
simple matter, and only requires a certain amount
of careful attention.</p>

<p>For the keeping of soured milk, a cold room
cooled by a refrigerating machine would be desirable,
so as to maintain the fermented milk at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
low temperature and prevent over-fermentation.</p>

<p>Apparatus has been designed so as to handle
soured milk on a large scale, and one of the machines
is shown on the illustration (see Fig. 9).
It is simply a jacketed cylinder with a cover and
an agitating gear. The inside of the machine is
nickel-plated, and there is an arrangement whereby
the cooling may be done rapidly, through a coil
inside the jacket, this coil being connected to the
brine circulation of the refrigerating machine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig9" id="fig9"></a><img src="images/fig9.jpg" width="500" height="507" alt=

title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Continuous Apparatus for the Production of Large
Quantities of Soured Milk</span></p>

<p class="indent2"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 9&mdash;This apparatus is made by the Dairy Machinery and Construction
Company of Shelton, Conn., U S A. The milk is agitated
inside a jacketed cylinder, where it is allowed to incubate at about
blood heat. The milk can be rapidly heated and also rapidly
cooled by means of this apparatus.</p></div>

<p>The machine is filled with milk containing three
per cent. of fat, which has been previously pasteurised
to about 190&deg; F., and cooled down to about
90&deg; F.; at this point the pure culture of <i>Bacillus
bulgaricus</i> is introduced, and the agitator is kept
working, so as to mingle it thoroughly with the
milk. The agitator is then stopped until the
acidity shows a test of 0.9 to 1.0 per cent., when
the agitator is again started, and cold brine from
the refrigerating machine is turned on to the cooling
pipes, so that the product is thoroughly broken
up, and cooled down to 40&deg; F.</p>

<p>The milk is then transferred to a bottle-filling
machine (Fig. 10), poured into bottles and hermetically
sealed, after which it is ready for consumption.
When it has to be kept for any time it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>should be placed in a cold room where there is a
temperature not higher than 40&deg; F.</p>


<p>The process, therefore, is a simple one, and lends
itself to the ordinary dairy business, without involving
any great expenditure on account of a
new plant.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>

<h5>THE BACTERIOLOGY OF FERMENTED OR SOURED
MILK</h5>

<h6>A CHAPTER FOR STUDENTS</h6>

<p>During the last few years much work has been
done in investigating the action of various classes
of organisms&mdash;bacteria, yeasts, and moulds&mdash;upon
milk and its products. While, however, the attention
of the dairyman has been chiefly directed
to the propagation of acid-producing organisms
and the use of pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria
in their relation to butter and cheese making, a
new sphere in micro-biology has been disclosed
by the study of the effects caused by the combined
growth of two or more different classes of organisms
in milk and the consequent production of
lactic, alcoholic, and gaseous fermentations. The
simultaneous occurrence of these fermentative
changes is responsible for the formation of such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
beverages as keffir, koumiss, milk-wine, etc. It
has therefore become essential, in connection with
the study of new developments in the milk
industry, that we should make a more intimate
acquaintance with the bacteriology of the ferments
involved.</p>

<p><i>Keffir</i> (<i>kephir</i>, <i>kifyr</i>, <i>kiafyr</i>, <i>kephor</i>, <i>kyppe</i>) is
the name given to an acid, slightly alcoholic
drink, which for many centuries has been prepared
by the nomadic tribes in the Caucasus.
The characteristic fermentation is induced by
the addition of so-called keffir grains. These are
yellow or golden-yellow, warty, and furrowed
flakes or nodules, the former varying in size from
that of a rice grain to that of a bean, while the
latter are often about an inch across and one
eighth of an inch thick. Bearing in mind the fact
that the preparation of keffir has been carried on
for many centuries, it is not surprising that the
origin of these grains should be surrounded by
myths.</p>

<p>The belief is prevalent among the Mohammedan
tribes of the Caucasus that keffir grains were, in
the first instance, presented by Allah, as a sign
of immortality, to one preferred tribe. Others
hold that, in past ages, they were found by shepherds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
growing on a shrub in the Caucasian highlands;
while, according to Skolotowski,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> they were
originally found adhering to the walls of an oaken
vessel used for the preparation of airam. This is
a soured milk beverage similar to keffir, but possessing
a weaker alcoholic fermentation, and prepared
from goats' milk by the addition of pieces of
calf's stomach. This would undoubtedly serve
to introduce various species of lactic acid bacteria,
and will be referred to in the portion dealing with
soured milks. Keffir is prepared by the Caucasians
from cows', sheep's, or goats' milk, and the operation
is carried on in large leathern tubes or bottles.
After the addition of the grains or seeds to the
milk the vessel is placed in a cool chamber, and the
fermentation is allowed to proceed for one or two
days, by the end of which time the normal fermentation
is at an end. During this period the
keffir grains have increased enormously in size,
assume a bright yellow colour, and lose their
sour buttery smell.</p>

<p>Previous to the removal of the fermented
liquid, a portion of the bottle is firmly bound from
the rest by a stout cord, and the greater portion
of the remaining keffir is quickly removed for use,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
thus avoiding, as far as practicable, any outside
infection. After the addition of fresh warm milk
the cord round the end of the bottle is removed,
and the old and new milk thoroughly mixed for a
time in order to ensure uniform inoculation of the
new milk for the next fermentation. During the
winter months the leathern vessels are often placed
in the sunshine, so that the temperature remains
at 61&deg; to 65&deg; F.</p>


<p>The necessary agitation of the vessel is said to
be supplied in the form of kicks by passers-by
or by the children during their play.</p>

<p>The beverage prepared in this way is so gaseous
in character that it is often blown forcibly from
the vessel during removal, and possesses, according
to Podowyssozki,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> a very acid taste.</p>

<p>During any interruption in the preparation of
keffir in the above manner, the grains are taken out,
and after having been well washed in clean water, are
spread out on a clean cloth to dry in the sunshine.
They thereby assume a characteristic cheesy or
buttery odour and become rather darker in colour.
Thorough desiccation is essential in order to prevent
subsequent mouldiness or disease of the grain.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
In European countries the grains are subjected
to a preliminary soaking in water for five to six
hours and then placed in four to five changes of
milk, each change having a duration of two to
three hours. As soon as the grains commence
to rise to the surface of the milk, they may be
used for the actual preparation. To this end,
a small quantity of the grain is added to freshly
boiled milk and allowed to stand for eight to
twelve hours at a temperature of 55&deg;-62&deg; F.
with agitation of the flask every two hours. By
this time the milk, now known as Sakwaska, has
become abundantly inoculated with the organisms
essential to the fermentation, and after the removal
of the grains, may be poured into well-corked flasks
for the secondary brew. The flasks should be
kept at a lower temperature for twenty-four to
forty-eight hours, by which time the product
is ready for consumption.</p>

<p>According to the temperature and length of
period to which this subsequent fermentation
is allowed to proceed, the resultant keffir is more
or less acid and gaseous. The grains may again
be used for starting a fresh portion of milk, and
a regular supply obtained in this manner. Well-fermented
forty-eight-hours-old keffir should be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
an effervescent beverage with prickling and acid
taste and a consistency and smell similar to sour
cream. Large, persistent bubbles should form
on the surface of the liquid and the casein be
present as an extremely fine flocculent precipitate
which remains suspended for a considerable
time.</p>

<p>From the third day there ensues a gradual
peptonisation of the casein. If the temperature
at which the secondary fermentation has occurred
should be higher than 72&deg; F., or if the milk has
not been sufficiently agitated, then the casein will
be present in the form of porous small flakes,
which on shaking form a fine emulsion.</p>

<p>The chemical changes undergone by the milk
during the preparation of keffir are confined almost
exclusively to the milk sugar. As already stated,
a slight peptonisation occurs in old samples, but
this depends very largely upon the method of
preparation and purity of the culture. Hammersten<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
and Essaulow<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> show, however, that this
is not a concomitant of normal fermentation.
According to Hammersten, normal keffir contains&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Biology of the Keffir Grain.</i>&mdash;The first communication
on the biology of the keffir grain seems
to have been made by Kern.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> He regarded
the grain as a zo&ouml;gl&oelig;a composed of bacilli and
yeasts, the latter being regarded as the ordinary
beer yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisse&aelig;</i>), while to
the former he gave the name of <i>Dispora caucasica</i>.
As the name indicates, this bacillus possesses two
polar spores, and germination of these proceeded
in the same manner as with <i>Bac. subtilis</i>. As,
however, pure cultures of the organisms were not
made, and the descriptions and illustrations made
by Kern fail to show any distinctive characteristics,
it seems probable that accidental confusion with
other organisms must have occurred.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>Krannhals<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> succeeded in isolating ten different
keffir bacteria among which were several sporulating
bacteria. Here too it is impossible to attach
any importance to the results, as the artificial
preparation of keffir, by means of these bacteria,
was not attempted. Beijerinck<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> studied the organisms
constituting keffir grains and attached
prime importance to the occurrence of two organisms,
viz., (<i>a</i>) a yeast, <i>Saccharomyces kefir</i>, which
was capable of inverting milk sugar by means of
an enzyme (lactase) and afterwards fermented
the products with the formation of alcohol and
carbon dioxide, and also (<i>b</i>) a non-motile non-sporulating
bacterium, afterwards <i>Lactobac. caucasicus</i>.
The latter, when cultivated on gelatine,
gave rise to tough warty colonies about 1/40 in.
diameter, and was regarded as one of the lactic
acid bacteria found in milk which has been incubated
at 77&deg; to 90&deg; F. and afterwards incubated
at a higher temperature, 100&deg; to 104&deg; F. Scholl<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
isolated three different organisms, of which a yeast
inverted milk sugar for the lactic acid bacteria,
while <i>Dispora</i> peptonised the albuminoid matters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p><p>Adametz<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> failed to isolate <i>Dispora</i>, and came to
the conclusion that ordinary lactic bacteria and
yeasts played the most important part in the
fermentation.</p>

<p>Essaulow found in keffir grains six different
organisms&mdash;yeast cells, cocci, short thick bacilli,
bent bacilli, long threads, and motile bacteria.
The two latter would seem to be <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>,
while the others may be regarded as <i>Bacterium
acidi lactici</i> (Hueppe), <i>Bacterium a&euml;rogenes</i>, and
<i>Streptococcus lacticus</i> (Grotenfeldt). Pure cultures
were insufficient to produce keffir, while
mixed cultures of <i>Bacterium acidi lactici</i> and yeasts
were effective.</p>

<p>Freudenreich,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> to whom we owe a record of
very carefully executed experiments, could not
arrive at a satisfactory explanation of the r&ocirc;le of
<i>Bacillus caucasicus</i>. This organism is described
as being 5-6 &micro; long and 1 &micro; thick, slightly motile,
and possessing bright refractive spots at the
poles of the bacilli. It is extremely difficult to
cultivate, and forms flat, small greyish colonies
of irregular outline. The bright refractive spots
above referred to are, however, granules taking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>the usual stains quite readily, and not spores as
supposed by Kern.</p>


<p>Freudenreich also found three other organisms&mdash;a
yeast and two streptococci. The yeast, to
which he gave the name <i>Saccharomyces</i> (Torula)
<i>keffir</i>, forms small oval or roundish cells 2-3 &micro;
wide and 3-5 &micro; long. The optimum temperature
would seem to be about 72&deg; F.; the maximum 82&deg;
F. This organism is unable to ferment milk
directly, but is able to decompose maltose and
glucose with gas production. It does not coagulate
milk, but imparts to it a characteristic taste
and is unable to withstand desiccation for more
than a few days.</p>

<p>Of the two streptococci isolated, <i>Streptococcus
a</i> resembles organisms of the group <i>Streptococcus
lacticus</i> in appearance, but is able to ferment milk,
with weak acid and gas production, and is capable
of inducing coagulation.<br /><br /></p>

title="" />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 11.&mdash;Section through a Kephir Grain.</p></div>

<p>Contrary to what one would expect in an organism
existing in keffir grains, this streptococcus is as
little able to withstand desiccation as the above-mentioned
yeast. <i>Streptococcus b</i> forms smaller
cells as well as smaller colonies than <i>Streptococcus a</i>,
but produces more lactic acid and more gas, and
retains its vitality after desiccation. The relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
of these four organisms is, according to E. von
Freudenreich, as follows: <i>Sacch. keffir</i> is unable
to ferment directly milk or lactose, so that its
growth must be preceded by that of <i>Streptococcus
b</i>. <i>Streptococcus a</i> does not seem to play this part,
but, unlike <i>Streptococcus b</i>, is able to coagulate
milk on its own account. By the combined
action of the yeast and the two streptococci,
then, milk can be coagulated, milk sugar inverted,
acid and gas produced by the streptococci, while
gas and alcohol are formed by the activity of the
yeast. The r&ocirc;le of <i>Bacillus caucasicus</i> is unknown,
but it would seem to play a part in the
formation of the keffir grain itself. By means
of mixed cultures of the above organisms Freudenreich
was successful in obtaining a fermented
product possessing in all respects the characteristic
properties of normal keffir. On the other
hand, experiments to induce the formation of
keffir grains gave negative results, but in this
respect the cultural characteristics of <i>Lactobacillus
keffir</i> would seem to give promise of success
in the synthesis of the keffir grain. Fig. 11 is a
photo-micrograph of an extremely thin section
through a keffir grain, after a preceding treatment
with saffranin. The matrix is composed entirely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>of long thin bacilli (<i>Bacillus caucasicus</i>), while
the peripheral portions, which are more deeply
stained, consist to a large extent of dense masses
of yeast cells with occasional streptococci. In a
normal grain the latter organisms are present on
the surface or in the cavities and grooves of the
grain, and only to a less extent in the matrix.
Nikolaiewa<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> claimed to have isolated a hitherto
unknown bacillus capable of coagulating milk
by acid production, <i>Bacterium caucasicum</i>, not
identical with, but related to Freudenreich's
<i>Bacillus caucasicus</i>, and also a torula. Although
no experiments were carried out, Nikolaiewa
asserts that this organism forms the matrix of the
grains. He was able to produce a beverage
resembling keffir, just as Freudenreich and Essaulow
did with entirely different organisms, but his
product would appear to have been slightly too
acid and to have lacked the characteristic aroma of
the normal product. In the course of an extensive
series of experiments Kuntze<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> found the
following organisms:</p>

<div class="blockquot3"><p class="indent4">(<i>a</i>) True lactic acid forming bacteria, <i>Streptococcus
acidi lactici</i> (Grotenfeldt).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p class="indent4">(<i>b</i>)
Bacteria of the group <i>Bacterium acidi lactici</i>
(Hueppe) and <i>Bacterium lactis a&euml;rogenes</i>.</p>

<p class="indent4">(<i>c</i>) Various torula and yeast species.</p>

<p class="indent4">(<i>d</i>) Two species of butyric acid bacteria, <i>Bacillus
esterificans</i> and <i>Bacillus keffir</i> (Kuntze).</p></div>

<p>His conclusions are: 1. In any case the presence
of a yeast capable of directly fermenting
milk sugar is not essential. 2. The significance of
the presence of yeast lies in the fact that stimulation
of the lactic bacteria occurs; further, the yeast
exerts a regulating influence upon the rapidity of
the fermentation proper. The variety is of minor
importance, provided always that the yeast does
not produce an unpleasant flavour. By the use
of mixed cultures of <i>Bacillus esterificans</i>, <i>Bacillus
keffir</i>, and <i>Streptococcus acidi lactici</i>, and a keffir
yeast, Kuntze obtained a product that possessed
to the fullest degree all the characteristic properties
of a normal keffir. In such cultures he was successful
in obtaining the formation of keffir-like
grains. Keffir fermentation is, according to Kuntze,
the result of the action of various organisms.
During the initial stage butyric acid fermentation
takes place, but is prevented from becoming
predominant by the action of the keffir yeast.
Simultaneously a true lactic acid fermentation
proceeds and eventually gives place to a subsequent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> secondary production of butyric acid.
Finally, then, we have a certain amount of unison
in the results obtained by Freudenreich, Essaulow,
Nikolaiewa, and Kuntze. These show that, for
the production of a characteristic keffir, specific
organisms are not essential, provided always that
those used possess, either individually or collectively,
the essential capacity of acidifying, coagulating,
and fermenting the milk. For the growth
of normal grains the presence of a matrix-forming
organism, such as <i>Bacillus keffir</i>, is indispensable.<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Diseases of Keffir Grains.</i>&mdash;According to the age
and the previous treatment to which keffir grains
have been subjected, the vitality of one or more
of the organisms constituting the grain may have
been impaired. The results of Freudenreich have
shown that <i>Saccharomyces keffir</i> and <i>Streptococcus
a</i> are unable to withstand desiccation for more
than a few days, and this is sufficient to account
for the frequent failures to obtain normal keffir
from the grain. Further, grains succumb to a
mucilaginous disease; the cavities become filled
with a slimy fluid, and the grains are covered with
mucilaginous matter. They lose their elasticity
and become brittle or mealy, but large grains
appear to be more subject to this fault than do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the small ones. Such grains should be disinfected
by immersion for a short time in two per cent.
salicylic acid solution, followed by drying in
the sun, whereby they are completely regenerated.</p>

<p>Another disease consists in the predominance of
certain butyric acid bacteria which impart an
unpleasant rancid taste to the keffir (Podowyssozki).
This is generally attributed to the use
of rich milk, or too high a temperature during
preparation.</p>

<p><i>Koumiss.</i>&mdash;Another product of the combined
action of lactic acid and alcohol-producing organisms
is called koumiss, kumys, milk-wine, lac
fermentation, or vinum lactis. In the steppes of
Southern Russia and Asia, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> it
is prepared chiefly from mares' milk, but occasionally
from that of camels and jennets. The name
is said to be derived from that of a tribe mentioned
by Xenophon and Pliny, viz., the Kumanen, by
whom its preparation was practised. After the
war with the Tartars in 1215 its use was adopted
by the latter people, and eventually spread to the
Turkomanen, Kalmucks, Khirgiz, Mongolians, etc.</p>

<p>Rubruck, in 1253, records the use of a fermented
drink&mdash;kosmos&mdash;prepared from mares' milk, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>about the same time Marco Polo mentions the
occurrence of a milk-wine, chumis or chemius,
among the Tartars. The fact that the Tartars
were seldom ill, and were almost invariably free
from lung troubles, led to an influx of visitors
from surrounding countries, until finally its use
spread to Russia, Austria, and Germany. At
the present time the best koumiss is that produced
in the province of Orenburg; but specially equipped
koumiss establishments, under the control of
physicians, exist in Odessa, Samara, Ufa in the
Urals, and other districts. The curative properties
of koumiss have long been recognised and its
use is indicated in cases of indigestion, chlorosis,
scurvy, tuberculosis, etc.</p>

<p>Rubinsky states that, among the nomadic tribe,
of Khirgiz and Kalmucks, a special leathern bottle
(Turssuk, Orroth, or Soaba) is used for the preparation
of koumiss, while wooden tubs (Tschiljak)
similar in shape to the old-fashioned churn are
used by the Bashkirs, and in koumiss establishments.</p>

<p>The fermentation is induced by the addition
of koumiss to fresh mares' milk, in proportions
which vary according to the cleanliness observed
in the actual preparation. Where the process
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
is carefully controlled, one part of koumiss to
ten parts of milk is often used, but where gross
infection from outside sources takes place one
part of koumiss to three parts of milk is taken.
The mixture is stirred at frequent intervals, and
stored at a temperature of 73&deg;-90&deg; F. Weak
koumiss is obtained after twenty to twenty-four
hours in winter and twelve to fourteen hours in
summer, but is scarcely ever consumed immediately,
as it possesses a strong purgative action.</p>

<p>It is generally poured into bottles (bottled koumiss);
or allowed to remain in the tubs (tschiljak
koumiss); in the former case the fermentation
is ana&euml;robic, in the second it is a&euml;robic.</p>

<p>Storage of the koumiss upon ice or in a cellar
is necessary since medium koumiss is converted
to strong koumiss in twelve to sixteen hours at
ordinary temperatures, while at the lower temperature
this occurs only in two to four days.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>According to Biel,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> either old koumiss or the
dried sediment from old koumiss may be used for
the initial inoculation.   It may also be prepared
by the repeated inoculation of mares' milk with
soured cows' milk until a fermenting product is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>obtained. Koumiss may be prepared by a method
stated by Allik<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> to be in general use in the Caucasian
health-resorts. One part of beer-yeast is
added to four to ten parts of fresh mares' milk
(according to the strength of product required),
and after thorough mixture of the two liquids the
whole is allowed to ferment at a temperature of
70&deg; to 72&deg; F. for two days. One part of this first
product is then added to five parts of fresh cold
milk, and allowed to stand three to four hours
at 75&deg; to 77&deg; F. It is then poured into bottles,
and after the expiration of another three to four
hours is stored away in a cellar at about 45&deg; F.
This koumiss may be used at any time from one
to five days (generally two to three) after bottling
according to the strength desired or prescribed
in each individual case.</p>

<p>The changes undergone during fermentation
consist in a vigorous gas and acid production
accompanied by alcohol formation and coagulation
of the milk. The coagulum exists in an extremely
fine state of division, and the liquid froths violently
on the bottle being opened. It has a full pleasant
acid taste, but should not contain more than one
per cent. acid and two per cent. alcohol. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>specific gravity of koumiss is 1.008 to 1.020 at
60&deg; F. Appended is an analysis of two different
samples of koumiss:<br /><br /></p>

<p>Fleischmann<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> gives a formula for preparing
an artificial koumiss from separated cows' milk,
water, cane sugar, and milk sugar, with the addition
of distillery yeast. Needless to say, this product
must possess some of the characteristic by-flavour
of the yeast employed, and is less suitable than
koumiss prepared by the aid of a lactic yeast.
Schipin investigated the fermentation of koumiss
and found three distinct organisms.</p>


<p>Rubinsky in a recent article threw much light
on the phenomena of koumiss fermentation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>According to him, koumiss contains almost invariably
four different organisms, viz., koumiss
yeast, koumiss bacterium (<i>Lactobacillus</i>), <i>Streptococcus
lactis</i> (Lister), <i>Bacterium a&euml;rogenes</i>, and
occasionally <i>Bact. caucasicum</i> (Nikolajewa). For
the preparation of normal koumiss only the two
former organisms are required; they exceed in
number any of the other organisms whose presence
in the dairy is unavoidable. The presence
of the two latter organisms is favourable to the
production of good koumiss, as, by inducing a
preliminary lactic fermentation, they tend to
inhibit the growth of undesirable extraneous
bacteria, etc. In medium and strong koumiss
they die out on account of the amount of lactic
acid formed (1%).</p>

<p>Koumiss yeast possesses strongly differentiated
protoplasm, but lacks any cultural characteristics.
Abundant growth occurs in milk, and lactic acid
(0.3%), alcohol, carbon dioxide, albumens and
peptones, volatile acids, and aromatic substances
are formed.</p>

<p>Koumiss bacterium is related to the <i>Lactobacillus</i>
of various other fermented milks, and is similar
to <i>Bac. acidophilus</i>, and possesses like these a
distinct polymorphism (branched cells, long and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
short bacilli, etc.). It is non-sporogenous, has an
optimum temperature of 90&deg; to 97&deg; F., and possesses
cultural characteristics similar to those of
the rest of the <i>Lactobacilli</i>.</p>

<p>The by-products of koumiss yeast appear
to favour the growth of the koumiss bacterium,
as this organism, like the other <i>Lactobacilli</i>, is
favourably influenced by the presence of small
quantities of peptone, alcohol, and acid.</p>

<p>The organisms found by Schipin consisted of a
species of <i>Saccharomyces</i> and two bacilli, <i>Bacillus
acidi lactici</i> and a non-sporulating bacillus. The latter
organisms coagulate milk at 98&deg; F., but not
at room temperature, and although a minute description
of cultural characteristics is not given it
would seem to be related to <i>Bacillus</i> or <i>Lactobacillus
caucasicus</i>.</p>

<p><i>Leben Ra&iuml;b</i> or <i>Leben</i> (<i>Laban.</i>)&mdash;This is a beverage
prepared largely by the Egyptians, and
differs from keffir, as does matzoon, in possessing
a characteristic aroma and taste. It differs also
from the former by having only a very weak
alcoholic fermentation, and by the coagulum
being coarse and lumpy instead of being extremely
fine. It is made from buffaloes', goats', or cows'
milk by the addition of roba (or old leben) to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
previously boiled and cooled fresh milk. The
use of leben is many centuries old, and it is used
in Egypt as in Arabia for medicinal purposes,
although that of the Syrians and Arabians is said
to differ from that of the Egyptians and Algerians.
The fermentative changes occurring in the formation
of the Egyptian leben have been investigated
by Rist and Khoury,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and also by Guerbet,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
who found that five organisms were normally
present. These comprised a chain-forming bacillus
(<i>Streptobacillus</i>), a second smaller bacillus
(<i>Bacillus lebenis</i>), a diplococcus, a saccharomyces,
and a mycoderma. Of these five organisms, it
would appear that four live in metabiosis, the
streptobacilli and bacilli hydrolyse the milk sugar,
the components of which are split up by the yeast
to alcohol and carbon-dioxide. The alcohol thus
formed, together with the glucose formed by
hydrolysis, are eventually converted to acid or
combusted by the mycoderma species. The leben
thereby assumes the sharp, unpleasant flavour
met with in old samples. The diplococcus merely
produces acidification and coagulation of the milk.
Rist and Khoury were able, by the use of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>organisms, to produce normal leben, especially
when the true yeast was allowed to grow in the
milk for some time before inoculation with the
other organisms was made.</p>

<p>Some of the half-civilised tribes of Siberia, the
Tartars and the Burgaten, prepare a strong
alcoholic beverage, arak&agrave; or ojr&agrave;n, from fermented
milk. This is really a product of distillation, and
contains seven to eight per cent. of alcohol and
volatile fatty acids.</p>

soured milk" title="" />

<p class="indent2"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 13&mdash;Photo-micrograph of preparation from Armenian
soured milk (Matzoon). This is related to Yoghourt,
and contains, as will be seen from the above photo,
yeasts, streptococci, diplococci, and a bacillus with
the morphology of <i>Bacillus bulgaricus.</i> This, and
similar foods, owe their peculiar properties primarily
to the presence of <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> (type A, White
and Avery), and only in a lesser degree to the yeasts
and lactic streptococci.</p></div>

<p><i>Matzoon.</i>&mdash;This is a drink used largely in
Western Asia, and is similar in character to keffir,
but has a peculiar taste which distinguishes it
from all other fermented milks. According to
Weigmann,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> it is prepared from buffaloes', goats',
or cows' milk, and is used partly as a means of
souring milk for butter-making and also as a lactic
food, eaten with spoons. In the same way buttermilk
produced from milk which has been previously
ripened by matzoon is used as a beverage. Finally,
the coagulum (<i>than</i>) of such buttermilk is
strained off, and, after being pressed, is mixed
with meal and dried by exposure to the sun's
rays. The preparation of matzoon is in many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>respects very similar to that of keffir and koumiss,
but differs by inducing a comparatively weak
alcohol fermentation. In common, too, with yoghourt,
the prevailing temperature is much higher
than is required for keffir and koumiss.</p>

<p>In regard to the biology of matzoon, the occurrence
of various organisms has been recorded.
Emmerling<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> isolated, in addition to a yellow pigment-forming
organism, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, <i>Bacillus
lactis acidi</i>, and several fungi, a small
micrococcus capable of hydrolysing milk- and cane-sugar.
The organism produces and without gas
formation, or peptonisation of the medium. Of
the nine yeasts isolated from matzoon by Lindner<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
and Kalantharianz,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> three were able to ferment
milk sugar without previous hydrolysis, while
two others, by the simultaneous production of
lactic acid and fruit esters, gave to the matzoon
its characteristic taste and aroma.</p>

<p><i>Yoghourt and Soured Milk.</i>&mdash;Yoghourt is another
fermented milk, and is related to the matzoon of
Armenia, the gioddu of Sardinia, and the leben
of Egypt. After a preceding boiling and reduction
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>of the volume of the milk, inoculation of the mass
is made by the addition of a small quantity of
old culture, and it is then allowed to sour at a
comparatively high temperature. A moderately
compact, jelly-like coagulum is thus formed, while
keffir and koumiss possess a liquid consistency.
The fermentation necessary for the two latter
products only proceeds, too, at a much lower
temperature, at which yeasts play an important
part. According to Guerbet, yoghourt incubated
for ten hours at 113&deg; F. contained 0.34 per cent.
lactic acid and 0.012 per cent. alcohol. Luerssen
and K&uuml;hn<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> came to the conclusion that yoghourt
contained chiefly a mixture of <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i>,
diplostreptococci, and a "granule" bacillus, so
called on account of its granulated appearance
after treatment with methylene blue. According
to these authors, the first two organisms were
found in each of eight samples of maya (young
yoghourt) and of yoghourt itself, but the occurrence
of the "granule" bacillus in plate cultures was
by no means regular. In addition, yeasts were
found in almost every sample examined, but were
regarded more as accidental infections rather than
as essential to the formation of a typical product.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>The combined action of the three organisms
already mentioned gave rise to a product closely
resembling normal yoghourt. Piorkowski<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> subjected
Bulgarian maya to examination and associated
himself with Metchnikoff<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> in finding three
species, a streptococcus, a diplococcus, and a
specific organism to which he gave the name
<i>Yoghourt bacillus</i>. Similar results were also obtained
by Grigoroff.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Piorkowski's <i>Yoghourt bacillus</i>
is similar in form to <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, but does
not sporulate, nor does it liquefy gelatine. Young
individuals are stained by Gram's method; older
individuals are, however, Gram negative. The optimum
temperature is 112&deg; F. Kuntze attempted
to isolate the organisms mentioned by Luerssen
and K&uuml;hn, and by plate culture procured growth
of a spore-forming bacillus similar to Weigmann's
<i>Bacillus matzoon</i>. To this organism is attributed
the power to impart a specific taste to the matzoon,
but as growth is comparatively slow, it can only
be of significance in determining the quality of
the curd and cheese prepared from this product.
Cultures were also obtained which resembled in
general character those of the organism described
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>by Luerssen and K&uuml;hn as <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> and
named by Kuntze <i>Bacterium W</i>. Granule formation
was transient in this culture, and the
organisms eventually became inactive. Further
analysis of maya gave cultures of the "granule"
bacillus, but these passed over from the type
forming irregular colonies (see Figs. 14, 15, 16)
to that producing smooth colonies. Further,
although the granule formation persists largely
in milk, the organisms soon revert to the non-granular
type if cultivated on agar. By the use
of the Gram-Weigert stain organisms from a
several-days-old culture on beer-wort-agar gave
an interesting reaction. The bacillar threads are
in places Gram-negative, in others Gram-positive,
and bear small club-like swellings (see Fig. 14).
Results similar to these were also obtained with
cultures of <i>Bacillus matzoon</i> (Weigmann and
Gr&uuml;bner) and also with <i>Bacillus acidophilus</i>.</p>

<p>Neisser's method of staining failed to give such
good effects by the examination of fresh maya,
as did an alcoholic aqueous solution of methylene
blue in showing up the granules of the organisms.
Again, Grixoni<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> found, but did not isolate, a
similar granule-forming organism (<i>Bacterium sardous</i>)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
in Sardinian gioddu. As already mentioned
in the description of leben, Rist and Khoury
found a long bacillar lactic ferment (<i>Streptobacillus
lebenis</i>) which also exhibited the irregular greyish
white hairy colonies and high optimum temperature
characteristic of this group. On account
of the similarity in form, staining reactions, temperature
requirements, and cultural growth of
the organisms described by Emmerling, D&uuml;ggeli,
Weigmann, Grixoni, and Rist and Khoury, Kuntze
is inclined to regard them as belonging to one single
group of lactic ferments. According to him the
granule formation is rather variable, and may be
induced or suppressed by cultural methods. Not
only do organisms of this group produce far more
acid than the normal lactic bacteria; they are
also more resistant to acid, and are able to develop
in milk to which 0.5 per cent. hydrochloric acid
has been added. A comparatively high percentage
of alcohol seems to encourage growth, and this
was obtained in milk containing 4 per cent. alcohol.
This would no doubt tend to explain the
phenomenon observed by Kuntze that milk is not
so rapidly fermented by organisms of this group
as when cultures of diplococci and yeasts are
added. Since organisms of this group would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
seem to be widely distributed, the question of
their natural habitat arises. Luerssen and K&uuml;hn
were unsuccessful in their search for such organisms
in K&ouml;nigsberg milk, but Leichmann records
the occurrence of a long bacillus (<i>Bacillus lactis
acidi</i>) in milk that had spontaneously soured at
112&deg; to 120&deg; F. This organism, too, showed
characteristic growth on agar media, and produces
l&aelig;vo-rotatory lactic acid. The examination
of calves' stomachs showed, according to Kuntze,
only occasional long bacilli, but inoculation of
sterile milk and incubation at 100&deg; F. with repeated
over-inoculation gave a culture showing the
characteristic granule reaction (see Figs. 18 and 20).
Although plate cultures made direct from calves'
stomachs do not exhibit the regular contours
generally shown by the granule bacillus, yet this
growth may be induced by preceding cultivation
in lactose bouillon to which 0.5 per cent. acetic
acid has been added. A similar organism, <i>Bacillus
acidophilus</i>, was isolated from calves' manure
by means of this acetic bouillon, as was also a
diplostreptococcus which resembled very closely
the typical lactic acid streptococcus. This resemblance
was made all the more striking by the fact
that they were capable of coagulating milk at a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>temperature of 99&deg; to 104&deg; F. Since these organisms
are present in large numbers in manure and
also in the digestive tract of ruminants, it would
seem probable that their occurrence is not without
significance for the operations of cheese manufacture.
According to Jensen, the practice of
applying farmyard manure to Swiss meadows
has been regarded as absolutely essential to the
production of cheese of the best quality; while,
on the other hand, the application of artificial
manures would seem to have been responsible
for an increase in abnormal cheese. K&uuml;ntze
found further that by the combined inoculation of
sterile milk with the diplostreptococcus and the
"granule" bacillus from calves' stomachs, together
with a yoghourt yeast, he was able to obtain
a product possessing a taste and aroma little
different from normal yoghourt. During their
investigations upon the ripening of Swiss hard
cheese, Freudenreich and Jensen<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> isolated five
varieties of lactic acid bacilli, and were able to
show that one of these, especially <i>Bacillus casei &#949;</i>,
was of the greatest importance for the production
of good cheese. This organism has been found
by Th&ouml;ni to be present in rennet tablets, while
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>a related variety, <i>Bacillus casei &#948;</i>, was found in
fresh calves' stomachs. Unfortunately, staining
tests with these organisms were not carried out,
so that no data are available in regard to the
presence of granules. The photo-micrographs of
these organisms show the small clubs and true-branched
forms. The presence of these diplococci
and bacillar lactic ferments in the intestinal
tract of ruminants and horses might possess some
importance for the preparation of yoghourt in
bags or tubes made from the stomachs of these
animals. Finally, Moro<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> has isolated an acidophilic
organism from the dejecta of infants which
resembles closely, both in manner of growth, resistance
to acids, true branching, and temperature
optimum, the granule bacillus and related forms.</p>

of the so-called Bulgaricus group, and known at
present as <i>Bacillus-bulgaricus</i>, <i>Streptobac. lebenis</i>,
<i>Bacillus of Massol</i>, <i>Granule bacillus</i>, <i>Bact. Mazun</i>,
<i>Bac. lactis acidi</i>, etc.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>White and Avery<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> have made a comparative
study of a large number of varieties and species
of lactic acid bacteria of the above type obtained
from various fermented milks and milk tabloids.
Their descriptions are so detailed and their conclusions
are so important that we give them at
length. According to this work, the whole of the
thermophilic lactic acid bacilli of the so-called
Bulgaricus type may be divided into two sub-types,
A and B.</p>


<div class="center"><i>The Cultural Characteristics of the Bacillus Bulgaricus
Group</i></div>

<p>The cultural characteristics of all the strains
of <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i> (granule bacillus) are as
follows:</p>

<p><i>In Whey Agar.</i>&mdash;All strains exhibit wide variation
in size, 2 &micro; to 50 &micro; long and about 1 &micro; broad.
Almost all individuals are intensely Gram-positive,
and show regularity of outline. All strains
show involution form, exhibiting vacuoles, and
often show empty cell membranes. The latter
are Gram-negative, and vary greatly in both
dimensions as well as in form. All strains show
tendency to chain formation, some being arranged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>in chains of six to twenty-five segments, which
may contain both Gram-positive and Gram-negative
individuals. Type B exhibits Gram-negative
spherical bodies varying from 0.25 &micro; to 1 &micro; in
size, adhering to the sides of some of the Gram-negative
individuals.</p>


<p><i>In Whey.</i>&mdash;In this medium there is a marked
tendency toward degeneration and involution.
In the early stages of incubation, at 100&deg; to 112&deg; F.,
the bacilli are uniform in size and intensely Gram-positive;
in succeeding stages the irregular, vacuolated,
inflated, and ruptured forms predominate.
Between the eighteenth and twenty-fourth hours
of incubation at 112&deg; F. the strains of type A
develop oval to kidney-shaped nodules attached
to a stem extending from the cell substance.
As the incubation is prolonged these nodules
increase in size, often measuring 1 &micro; to 2 &micro; in
length; this nodule formation occurs at the expense
of the cell protoplasm, and appears to be
a marked characteristic of growth in whey. Cultures
of type B do not form nodules or clubs, but
small spherical bodies more or less securely attached
to the cell wall are seen. Again, type A
assumes the form of small bacilli in chains, while
type B strains develop to a greater length and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>exist almost exclusively as single isolated forms.
True branching has been observed in strains of
type B.</p>

<p><i>In Milk.</i>&mdash;In milk there is a tendency to thread-formation
consisting of four to ten segments in
the case of type A, while type B shows longer
and more curved forms. With increasing age
of the culture there also appears to be increase
in the length of the organisms. All strains are
non-motile, non-sporogenous, and non-capsule-forming.</p>

<p>Staining Reactions.&mdash;All strains are readily
stained by the usual aniline dyes.</p>

<p><i>A. Gram's Method.</i>&mdash;Young individuals give an
intense reaction with this stain; old bacilli are
easily decolourised, and degenerate forms are
always Gram-negative, while single individuals
have been observed which showed gradation from
one pole of the cell to the other.</p>

<p><i>B. Loeffler's Methylene Blue.</i>&mdash;According to the
behaviour of the organisms studied, a separation
into two types appears possible, type A being
uniformly impregnated, while type B shows distinct
differentiation. The cell body is seen to
contain a varying number of round to oval bodies
or granules. This is the appearance already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
mentioned by D&uuml;ggeli, Luerssen and K&uuml;hn, and
Kuntze, and from which the granule bacillus
derives its name. In opposition to the observations
of Kuntze, the occurrence of granules
was not found to be variable; it was, indeed, so
constant as to constitute a distinguishing characteristic
between the two types. The organisms
of this group are difficult to cultivate, and freshly
isolated growth is obtainable only on media containing
whey, malt, or in milk. They grow
equally well under a&euml;robic or ana&euml;robic conditions.
The optimum temperature for growth is 113&deg; to
115&deg; F.; growth is fair at 85&deg; F., slight at 75&deg; F.,
and does not take place at 68&deg; F.</p>

<p>Colonies on whey agar are round to irregular,
greyish white, curled and filamentous, often
streaming, and in a few cases smooth and even
in structure. Gelatine is not liquefied. There is
no surface growth on gelatine stab-cultures. Along
the stab the growth is filiform, beaded, with
subsequent horizontally projecting ramifications.
Milk is coagulated in eight to eighteen hours at
112&deg; F., and is the most favourable medium for
growth.</p>

the casein, and imparts a strong unpleasant cheesy flavour
to the beverage.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>Type A produces 2.7 per cent. to 3.7 per cent.
inactive lactic acid in milk, while type B produces
only 1.2 per cent. to 1.6 per cent. l&aelig;vo-rotatory
lactic acid in milk. There is a small quantity
of acetic, formic, and succinic acids formed.
The conclusions of White and Avery are:</p>

<p>I. A review of the morphological culture and
biochemical features of the lactic acid producing
bacilli from yoghourt, matzoon, and leben, appears
to justify their classification as a single
group.</p>

<p>II. This group would seem to be identical
with <i>Bacterium caucasicum</i> (Kern).</p>

<p>III. The significant variations exhibited by
these bacilli in regard to the presence or absence
of granules demonstrable by differential stains,
the degree of lactic acid production, and the nature
of the acid produced, suggest a division into
two different types&mdash;the true type A, and the
paratype B.</p>

<p>Quite recently Hastings and Hammer<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> recorded
the isolation from milk of an organism producing
more acid than either <i>Bacterium coli commune</i> or
<i>Bacillus lactis acidi</i>. It is characterised by possessing
a high optimum temperature, and by the
limited conditions under which it grows on nutrient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
media. On this account these investigators
suppose it to be related to those described in
the paragraphs on fermented milks, leben, matzoon,
etc., and which are regarded by Kuntze as
being identical.</p>

<p>Similarly Boutroux<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> found 1.5 per cent. acidity
produced in a solution containing albuminous
matter and glucose; while Richet<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> states that
with the addition of gastric juice to milk as much
as four per cent. acidity may be formed. After
storing samples of milk for eight days at 100&deg; F.,
Koning<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> found 2.35 per cent. and 2.5 acid; while
similar samples stored at 60&deg; to 62&deg; F. for the same
period only developed 0.9 per cent. Heinemann<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>
records the production of 3.0 per cent. acid in
milk incubated at 100&deg; F.; and Jensen states that
<i>Bacillus casei &#949;</i> is capable of developing 2.7 per
cent. lactic acid.</p>

<p>Dr. H. B. Hutchinson, bacteriologist at Rothamsted
Experimental Station, has also been
successful in isolating a bacillus from English
market milk resembling in every particular those
classified by White and Avery as type A.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that organisms related to
those of Oriental and Occidental milk beverages
are present in conditions where it is impossible
for them to attain to any active growth. The
same class of organism has also been found in
many cases in butter and cheese throughout the
United States.</p>

<p>Of recent years the consumption of milk fermented
by these organisms has been introduced
more or less successfully into all European countries.
This custom is due, as we have seen,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
to a very great extent to the announcement of
Metchnikoff<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> that the action of such organisms
in the alimentary tract conduce to a prolongation
of life. Moro found that the dejecta of
children contain large numbers of <i>Bac. lacidophilus</i>
and <i>Bac. bifidus</i>, but, as age advances, the
bacterial flora of the intestines tends to change.
The number of acid-producing organisms gradually
becomes less, and other bacteria capable of
producing far-reaching decomposition of albuminoid
matter tend to increase.</p>

<p>Working on the assumption that senility is
partially due to the absorption of by-products
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>formed from albuminoid food by the decomposing
or putrefactive bacteria mentioned, Metchnikoff
instituted a search for organisms capable
of suppressing the growth of the putrefactive
bacteria.</p>

<p>It has long been known that milk allowed to
become sour will keep for a considerably longer
period in hot weather than if lactic bacteria had
not grown. This preservative action of lactic
acid also comes into play in the manufacture of
sauerkraut and in the preservation of meat by
immersion in sour milk.</p>

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34.</span>&mdash;Photo-micrograph of smear of culture of <i>Bacillus bulgaricus</i>,
recommended by Metchnikoff for use in cases of intestinal auto-intoxication.
Unlike the ferments of normally soured milk, which are sometimes indifferent,
or even injurious, in their action, this bacillus is capable of growth at blood
heat, and, by producing much larger quantities of lactic acid than such organisms
as <i>Streptococcus lacticus</i>, <i>Bacillus coli commune</i>, or <i>Bacteria lacticus aerogenes</i>,
inhibits the multiplication of bacteria responsible for the putrefaction of
albuminoid food in the intestines.</p></div>

<p>Bienstock has shown that the growth of <i>Bac.
putrificus</i> is inhibited by the action of <i>Bact. coli
commune</i>, which is capable of setting up a slight
lactic acid fermentation. <i>Bact. coli commune</i>,
however, gives rise to substances of an injurious
character, and, although present very abundantly
in the intestinal tract, it may by reduced almost
entirely by the active growth of lactic acid bacteria.
This fact is of great value to the cheese-maker,
since by the addition of a lactic acid
culture (starter) to milk before renneting, gas-producing
bacteria such as <i>Bact. coli</i> may be checked
in growth. Since the ordinary lactic acid bacteria
such as <i>Streptococcus lacticus</i>, <i>Bac. lactis acidi</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>and others, are incapable of growth at blood
temperature, it appeared necessary to procure
cultures of lactic bacteria able to grow at temperatures
of 100&deg; F. to 112&deg; F. Such an organism
was found in Bulgarian soured milk (yoghourt),
and was considered pre-eminently adapted to
this purpose. As has been shown in the preceding
paragraphs, this organism is merely one of a
large group of bacteria found distributed in the
intestinal canal of many domestic animals, in
manure, and in ordinary market milk. It is then
not surprising that the introduction into the intestinal
tract of bacteria of the type <i>Bulgaricus</i> in
the form of tabloids has not met with any decided
success. Although it was considered to be merely
necessary to introduce the desired type of organism
into the body, and the amount of lactic acid
taken into the system by the administration of
soured milks was looked upon as of secondary
importance, yet, it would seem, in the light of
recent investigations, that benefits derived from
a soured milk regimen are attributable in part
to a chemical as well as a purely bacterial action.
This receives support from the fact that soured
milk beverages prepared by the use of ordinary
lactic bacteria, distinct from those of the <i>Bulgaricus</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
type, often exert a beneficial influence
upon human beings even although the organisms
responsible for the fermentation are incapable
of growth at blood temperature.</p>


<p>It may be mentioned in conclusion that cultures
prepared by the use of organisms of the
type <i>Streptococcus lacticus</i> combined with <i>Bac.
bulgaricus</i> possess a more agreeable flavour and
aroma than those prepared from a pure culture
of <i>Bulgaricus</i> alone.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI</h4>

<h5>THE PREPARATION OF SOURED MILK IN THE HOUSE</h5>


<p>There is no great difficulty in making soured milk
at home: the necessary operations are quite simple,
but at the same time they must be conducted
with precision and care, otherwise the results may
be unsatisfactory and disagreeable; there may even
sometimes be danger in badly prepared sour milk.
It is always an advantage in such matters to
understand the reason of things, and a few notes
on the surrounding conditions, and what has to
be accomplished, may be of assistance to the
would-be experimenter.</p>

<p>The majority of intelligent people are now acquainted
with the fact that the germs of bacteria
are to be found everywhere on the surface of the
earth, in air, and in water, and that they are the
sole cause of the decay of all manner of perishable
articles.</p>

<p>The distribution is unequal&mdash;bacteria are much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
more plentiful where there is decaying matter&mdash;in
dirty houses, sewage, or other contaminated
water, etc. Milk is a splendid food for bacteria,
and numerous varieties multiply in it exceedingly,
and many of these are injurious, producing
putrefactive changes which render the milk unwholesome,
even poisonous in some cases. Others
are beneficial, and are absolutely necessary for
the souring of milk for making butter or cheese
and for the ripening of the latter. The soured
milk which is the subject of this book is the
work of certain lactic-acid-producing bacteria,
and the problem we have before us is to encourage
the growth of the latter to the uttermost and
to exclude the others.</p>

<p>As bacterial germs are present in the air and
readily sow themselves into any medium with
which they come in contact, the first consideration
is to get good fresh milk which has been as little
exposed to the air as possible. The second is to
conduct the experiment where the germs are
fewest, and in cleanly surroundings, far removed
from decaying matter and free from taints and
smells.</p>

in order to induce a vigorous growth of the lactic
ferments in the body.</p></div>

"Photo-Micrograph of Smear from Milk that had been Allowed to Sour Spontaneously"
title="" />

<p class="cap"><span class="smcap">Fig. 40.</span>&mdash;Photo-micrograph of smear
from milk that had been allowed to sour spontaneously.
Ordinary market milk is always subject to infection
from the air, milking vessels, manure, etc., and from
these sources a mixed bacterial flora arises, with the
result that the milk exhibits curdling, acidity, gaseous
fermentation, or mould growth, after being stored for
a short time. This is due to the action of sush bacilli,
diplococci, yeasts, and moulds as are shown in this
illustration.</p></div>

<p>However fresh the milk may be, it will contain
useless or injurious bacteria, and we must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>get rid of these before attempting to introduce
those whose growth we wish to encourage. This
is effected by heat. All the living bacteria and
most of the germs are killed at temperatures
somewhat under the boiling point. Having sterilised
the milk in this way, it is necessary, as far
as possible, to prevent the entrance of fresh germs
from the atmosphere, and we therefore let the milk
cool down in covered dishes. When the temperature
descends to about 100&deg; F. the culture of the
special bacteria is introduced, the covers are
replaced, and the milk vessels maintained at or
near this temperature for twelve hours, when the
soured milk is ready for use. It is not necessary
to use fresh culture every time&mdash;a little of the
soured milk will take its place, and this may be
repeated as many as fourteen times before it is
necessary to start off again with a fresh culture.
A great deal depends on the care exercised and
the freedom of the surroundings from bacterial
germs. Under the best conditions wild germs
will gradually accumulate in the soured milk,
but their increase may be greatly delayed by
attention to the precautions mentioned. The
ordinary souring of milk for butter and cheese
making is conducted in cool surroundings, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
already stated, because in such conditions the
lactic-acid-producing germs increase relatively
faster than the wild germs, and so gain the upper
hand, but in the case of our special soured milk
we kill out, practically, all wild bacteria and
germs, and the pure culture having the field to
itself, we can conduct the operation at a higher
temperature where the action of the bacteria
is at its maximum, and so obtain the necessary
lactification in the minimum of time.</p>


<p>The appliances for the souring of milk on the
domestic scale require some consideration. We
propose to describe the principal forms of apparatus
which have been put on the market for the
purpose, and then to give such suggestions as
may assist the ingenious in making apparatus for
themselves. Those who wish for information on
the subject of larger apparatus will find it in the
following chapter.</p>

<p>The Society "Le Ferment" of Paris, which
has been authorised by Professor Metchnikoff
to prepare and supply to the public his sour milk
culture, provides an apparatus for the treatment
of the milk. It is shown in Fig. 45, which consists
of a double box having the intervening space
packed with a non-conducting material. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>provided with a tight lid. Inside, there is accommodation
for two milk vessels, each with a capacity
of about two thirds of a pint. The most
difficult thing in the souring of milk is to maintain
the temperature as nearly at 100&deg; F. as possible
while the culture is in action. This result is
attained by filling the vessel in the middle with
boiling water. The insulated walls hinder the
escape of heat, and the quantity of boiling water
used is calculated to maintain the temperature
steady for the twelve hours of cultivation; but
in cold, frosty weather it is necessary to refill
the central vessel with boiling water in the middle
of the period.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="fig45" id="fig45"></a>

"Apparatus of 'Le Ferment' Co."
title="" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45</span></p></div>

<p>The milk jars are washed with hot boiled water
and turned upside down to dry. They should
not be wiped with a cloth. Boil the milk to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
treated for ten minutes, stirring it to promote
evaporation, as it is advantageous to have it in
concentrated form. Cool rapidly to 100&deg; F. by
placing the boiling vessel in cold water, add to
each bowl one third of a tube of the culture in
powder form, fill up with the boiled and cooled
milk, stir well and cover. Place the jars in the
box and fill the central vessel with boiling water,
shut the lid tight, and do not open it (unless
a fresh charge of boiling water is needed) for ten
or twelve hours, when it will be ready for use.
If the liquid culture is used (one small phial for
each bowl) the milk should be cooled to 86&deg; F.
instead of 100&deg; F., as with the powder. The
culture is also supplied in tabloid form. The
powder and tabloids keep well, but the liquid can
only be relied on for about two months. The
milk prepared as above should be stored in a cool
place, the lids being kept on the bowls. It is
good for about two days, after which it becomes
too sour. It can be eaten with sugar, which
not only sweetens it but is beneficial in affording
additional suitable food for the acid-producing
bacilli. If fresh milk cannot be had, condensed,
sterilised, or pasteurised milk may be used, but,
of course, fresh milk is best. Condensed milk
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>should be diluted with two parts of boiling water
and then treated like ordinary milk.</p>

<p>An apparatus on similar principles is sold by
the Maya Bulgare Company, Ltd., and is illustrated
in Fig. 46.</p>

<p>The box is insulated, but the door is on the side,
the hot water vessel is underneath, and the covered

placed on a shelf above. In the front of the
illustration are shown the various packages in which
the liquid and powder cultures are put up. The
procedure is exactly the same as with "Le Ferment"

of a water vessel mounted
on a stand. The milk vessels
(tumblers) are placed in the
water, and the temperature
maintained at the proper figure
by a small night light burning
underneath. It is recommended
that the milk should be placed in an earthenware
jar or jug, which is stood in a pot of water kept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
boiling for an hour. After cooling add from three
to six previously crushed tabloids of culture, and
stir well with a glass rod which has been sterilised
in boiling water. The milk is then transferred to
three tumblers, which it should fill, and these are
put into the water vessel, the water in which
should be at about 100&deg; F., and the night light
started.</p>


<p>Messrs. Allen &amp; Hanbury, Limited, also make
use of the night light to maintain the proper
temperature during incubation in their "Sauerin"
apparatus (Fig. 48).</p>

<p>No water, however, is placed in the metal
container. The procedure is the same as that
already described, and both tablet and liquid
pure cultures are supplied. For children it is
recommended that the incubation should occupy
from three to four hours only, in other cases eight
to ten hours. Grated nutmeg, ground cinnamon,
or other flavouring, and cream may be used
with the soured milk.</p>

<p>The night light is also employed in the "Veronelle"
apparatus of Messrs. Clay, Paget and
Company, Limited (Fig. 49).</p>

<p>The containing vessel is of tin or aluminium,
and has two stands, the high one for hot and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>the low one for cold weather, as in the latter case
greater heat is needed to maintain the incubating
temperature. The milk is placed in an earthenware
jar and is sterilised by placing it in a saucepan
of water and boiling it; continuing the boiling
for half an hour. It is allowed to cool to about
98&deg; F., and placed in the incubator, culture added,
and the lamp lighted, the cover of the incubator
being kept on. The period of incubation is given
as six hours. To prepare the next day's supply a
tablespoonful of the soured milk is retained and
used instead of the culture. This may be continued
for fourteen days, when a fresh start
with culture is necessary. The soured milk will
keep for thirty-six hours. Capacity, one and one
half and two pints; also a large size for family use.</p>

<p>For the preparation of soured milk on a small
scale, one of the various forms of vacuum flasks
now on the market may be used with satisfactory
results. A little cold water must be poured
into the flasks, and warm water added, until,
by means of three to four changes, boiling water
can be safely poured in without cracking the
flask.</p>


<p>This boiling water must be allowed to remain
in for about twenty minutes, and then replaced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
by freshly boiled milk that has been cooled, so
that its temperature in the flask is about 105&deg; F.
The culture of lactic organisms should then be
added, the opening of the flask plugged with clean
cotton-wool, and the cap screwed on.</p>

<p>In an actual test, the temperature of the milk
placed in such a flask was 105&deg; F., at 7.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>,
and had dropped to 93&deg; F. by 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, the following
day. The milk was curdled, and possessed
the normal acid taste of such cultures.</p>

<p>The different types of apparatus are all quite
simple, and it would be easy to make something
at home. Get two round tins, the one less in
diameter by from two to three inches than the
other, put one or two pieces of wood across the
bottom inside the larger tin, and fill up the space
between with cotton-wool, which is an excellent
non-conductor of heat. Place the smaller tin
centrally inside the larger one. Fix three or four
distance pieces of wood in the space between them,
fill up with cotton-wool, leaving a little space at
the top to permit the lid of the smaller tin to be
fixed on. The boiling-water vessel may be a tin
saucepan with a lid, but no handle, and its proper
place would be on the bottom of the inner tin.
A tripod stand made of three pieces of wire bound
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
together, and with legs reaching past the hot-water
vessel to the bottom of the tin, would support
a false bottom of tin forming the shelf on
which the vessels of milk to be treated would
rest. These might be tumblers covered with
tin lids. To prevent radiation through the lid
of the inner tin, a thick pad or hood of
cotton-wool packed between cloth would be
placed over the top. A little experimenting
would be necessary to determine the quantity
of boiling water required to maintain the proper
temperature.</p>

<p>The soured milk obtained in the above manner
is of the consistency of ordinary buttermilk; a
separation of whey frequently takes place, and
this may be poured off if desired. The taste
and flavour should be pleasantly acid and agreeable,
and both are distinctive enough to give a
good idea of the purity of the product. In many
places a more concentrated article is made by
boiling down the milk to one half or one third
of its bulk, and then fermenting it in the ordinary
way. A kind of thick pudding is thus obtained,
which is highly recommended both as an agreeable
article of food and as a stronger medium for the
support of the germs it is the purpose of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
sour milk treatment to introduce into the digestive
system.</p>

<p>The cultures for making soured milk can now
be had from all the leading wholesale and retail
chemists, with directions as to the quantities to
be used.</p>

<p>It is very necessary that the milk used should
be not only fresh and good, but also free from
chemical preservatives. The effect of these is to
inhibit the growth and development of bacteria,
and they have therefore an injurious influence
on the special lactifying germs it is our object
to cultivate. Preservatives are now not nearly
so much used as they were, a few years ago, and
there should be no difficulty in obtaining milk
free from them.</p>

<p>For keeping both fresh and soured milk good
a small ice-chest is an excellent device. The
germs which are continually dropping into milk
kept in open vessels in the air, even in cleanly
surroundings, are mostly kept out in the close
ice-chest, and the low temperature prevents in
a natural way the development of the bacterial
germs already in the milk. For the preservation
of all kinds of foods the ice-chest is a capital
investment, not to mention the benefit of having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
cooled drinks, etc., as required. They manage
things well in this respect in the United States,
where ice is regarded as a necessity in the summer
time by even the poorest people, and is delivered
with the same regularity as the milk.</p>

<p>It is necessary to utter a word of warning as to
certain forms in which the sour milk bacillus is
being offered to the public. It is being compounded
with sugar, chocolate, and other articles,
and sold in the form of sweets, etc. There
is no reliable proof that these preparations are
valuable. Certainly, sugar is a medium in which
the lactifying germs can live, but the quantity
so introduced into the system must be very small
compared with what is obtained from properly
fermented milk. It takes some time, even with
strong cultures, to fix the acid-producing germs
in the large bowel where they are wanted, and
until proper evidence is forthcoming that confectionery
preparations are efficacious we would
recommend that only the regularly fermented
milk be used. It would save trouble, no doubt,
to treat oneself with a few chocolate creams containing
the necessary germs daily, but if the matter
is taken up seriously it will be better to take
some pains and stick to methods the efficacy of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
which has been demonstrated, leaving the others
until their <i>bona fides</i> has been proved. There
are always enterprising firms who are prepared
to simplify things for us, but we must make
sure that their simplifications are warranted.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VII</h4>

<h5>THE PREPARATION OF SOURED MILK IN THE DAIRY</h5>


<p>There is a tendency in certain medical quarters
to discourage the use of soured milk "made for
profit." This view leaves out of account the fact
that besides being of value in medicine, the article
in question is also an excellent food, which, as we
have seen, has been consumed by multitudes of
people for ages in many parts of the world. There
seems also to be satisfactory evidence that a larger
percentage than usual of the people who make
soured milk a staple of diet attain to a ripe old
age. How does it become such a dangerous
thing the moment the doctors get it into their
hands? Of course if a man has an acute disease
he places himself entirely in the hands of his
medical man, and eats what is prescribed for
him, or at least he ought to do so, and if he makes
such a submission he is entitled at least to the
comfort of being able to feel that his doctor is free
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
from unreasonable prejudices. For the implication
that an article "made for profit" is naturally
suspect casts an unwarranted stigma on a large
number of honourable people. There are dishonest
tradesmen just as there are dishonest and
careless doctors, but to saddle a whole class with
the offences of a few would not be a justifiable
proceeding in either case. Besides, it is not to
the interest of the manufacturing chemist or the
dairyman to turn out spurious cultures or bad
soured milk, and on the whole we see no reason
why they should not engage in the business.</p>

<p>The widespread use of soured milk in other
countries as a regular article of diet seems to
indicate that all manner of people, except those
suffering from diseases which necessitate medical
regulation of diet, might with probable benefit to
themselves add this article to their food list;
and it looks as if a good many of them intend doing
so, even if scandalised doctors threaten "to abandon
the cure."</p>

<p>The dairyman who knows his business does
not need to be told of the care which is necessary
to keep milk in good condition. The merely
commercial consideration of avoiding loss has made
him ready to inquire into the best means of prolonging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
the life of milk as a merchantable article.
For a time he relied on chemical preservatives,
but their day is now almost over, and filtration,
pasteurisation, and cold storage have taken their
place. Any one conversant with the trade knows
how widely these methods have been adopted of
late years; we may, therefore, assume that the
average dairyman has at his command milk
suitable for the incubation process.</p>



<p>The demand for soured milk is not as yet a
very large one, and the apparatus so far developed
for its production is meant for the treatment of
small quantities. After describing the principal
appliances at present in the market we propose
to make some suggestions as to the construction
of larger apparatus.</p>

<p>A firm which has given great attention to the
question of maintaining fixed temperatures is
that of Messrs. Charles Hearson &amp; Co., Ltd.
Their incubators for chicken hatching are known
all over the world; and their appliances for biological
incubation are very generally used in bacteriological
laboratories. With such experience
it was natural that they should turn their attention
to soured milk apparatus, and the result
is the "Lactobator" (Figs. 50 and 51).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
A copper vessel made to contain water has
placed in it a stoneware jar which holds two
gallons of milk; on the top is a lid which carries a
thermometer for indicating the temperature of
the milk. Heat is supplied by a gas ring under
the copper vessel; and in the gas supply is the
patent thermostat made use of by Messrs. Hearson
also in their biological and poultry incubators,
in which a capsule containing a liquid arranged
to boil at a certain predetermined temperature
is the regulating factor. When the liquid boils,
the capsule expands, and by certain mechanical
devices regulates the gas supply so as to produce
exactly the temperature required.</p>

<p>The procedure is as follows: The jar is filled
with milk, and water is run into the copper vessel
by the funnel until it runs over at the overflow
pipe. The thermostat is lifted off and the full
gas supply allowed to pass to the burner, the
temperature of the milk brought up to 180&deg; F.
and maintained for half an hour at this figure.
The gas is then turned off, and cold water run
through the funnel until the temperature of the
milk registers 95&deg; F. The culture is added, the
lid replaced, and the thermostat put into the pocket
at the side of the vessel; the gas relighted, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>when the temperature reaches 100&deg; to 106&deg; F.
the capsule of the thermostat will expand and
close the gas to a peep, which is just sufficient to
maintain the temperature within the above limits.
After eight hours the incubation is completed.</p>


<p>Edgar's patent apparatus, the "Lactogenerator,"
as provided by the Dairy Supply Co., Ltd.,
is shown in Fig. 52.</p>

<p>The milk is placed in a tinned copper-jacketed
vessel and water run in through a vertical pipe
until it runs off at the overflow.
Two gas connections are required
with cocks on each, the one to
heat up the milk to the boiling
point and maintain it at this for
thirty minutes. A skimmer which
has been placed in the milk lifts
out the coagulated protein and
albumen which rise to the top.
The cock is then shut and cold
water run through the jacket till the thermometer
shows 90&deg; F., when the culture is added, and the
other gas supply with the regulator turned on,
and the temperature is automatically maintained
at about 90&deg; F. Time of incubation eight to nine
hours. It is recommended to turn cold water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
into the jacket at the end of the period to prevent
overincubation.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar apparatus is that of the
Willows Refrigerating Co., Ltd. (Fig. 53), with
the exception that it has no automatic heat regulator.
It is made of tinned steel, and the operations
are the same, but the sterilising temperature
(obtained by a gas ring or hot plate) is given as
180&deg;, and the incubating temperature 100&deg; to
104&deg; F. for a period of twelve hours. Presumably
this temperature is maintained by a small gas
jet or other similar source of heat. The capacity
is two gallons.</p>

<p>In the apparatus hitherto described the milk
is sterilised in bulk, and is filled into bottles or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
jars after incubation, which is not a desirable
thing to do, unless the soured milk is for immediate
consumption, as there is likely to be contamination
with injurious germs from the atmosphere. In
the domestic apparatus the milk is usually incubated
in covered jars in which it can be kept
until required for use, and the practice on the
larger scale should be the same.</p>

<p>The Dairy Outfit Co., Ltd., have recognised
this in their "Lacto" apparatus
(Fig. 54).</p>

<p>A cylindrical vessel is set
loosely on a stand, beneath
which is a lamp calculated
to maintain the incubating
temperature. The milk is
placed in bottles with metal
screw tops, and these are
put into the cylindrical vessel;
water is run in round
them through the side funnel,
the vessel lifted off the stand,
and heated to sterilising point
on a stove. Cold water is
then run in through the
funnel until the temperature is low enough for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
incubation. Culture is added to each bottle
and the lids screwed on, the vessel lifted
on to its stand, and the lamp lighted. The
cover of the apparatus has a thermometer fixed
on it.</p>

<p>On the large scale the treatment of the milk
would take place entirely in the jars in which it
would be sent out, and the sterilisation and incubation
would be conducted in different pieces
of apparatus. The sterilisation would be effected
either (1) by direct steaming, or (2) by hot water
heated by steam. Fig. 55 shows the first type
of sterilisation. The tank is of wrought iron or
steel with strengthening pieces of angle iron.
The door, with pulleys and counterweight for
easy handling, is fastened steam-tight by hinged
bolts. The apparatus is mounted on a stand at
a convenient height for handling the bottles; and
in front is another stand with channel iron rails
to take the waggon in which the bottles or jars
to be sterilised are packed. When the door is
fast, steam is turned on, and regulated to produce
the proper temperature by the thermometer
fixed in the shell, in which a pressure gauge is
also secured. After sterilising, the door is opened
and the waggon drawn forward to the outside,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>allowed to cool, or removed elsewhere to cool,
and allow space for a new charge.</p>

be added, and the incubation allowed to proceed in an insulated
chamber.</p></div>


<p>The second method of sterilising is by hot
water, as in Fig. 56. The bottles or jars are placed
on a perforated false bottom in the rectangular
tank, water run in up to the necks, and steam
turned on; the lid is fastened with hinged and
hooked bolts; a thermometer fastened in the lid,
and with a long stem enclosed in metal, indicates
the temperature. At the end of the sterilising
process cold water is turned on, and at the same
time the overflow water cock is opened; the
cold water gradually reduces the temperature,
and the incubating point is quickly reached.</p>

<p>Incubation in bottles or jars, sterilised in these
ways, can best be conducted in an insulated room,
with say, six inches of silicate cotton, granulated
cork, or washed cow hair packed between two-inch
by six-inch battens, covered with matching
on either side, and lined with sheet zinc. It
would be an advantage to have an air-lock or
anteroom into which the waggons or trays of
sterilised jars could be run, and the door of the
anteroom closed before the door of the insulated
room is opened. This would tend to prevent
variations of temperature in the room, and also,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
by checking free communication with the outside
air, decrease contamination. The waggons
of jars would be run in, and culture added
to each jar by a sterilised pipette. The atmosphere
of the room would be kept pure by running
in air frequently through a filter of moist cotton-wool
by means of an electric fan, and at intervals
the interior would be sterilised by the use of
formalin vapour.</p>

<p class="cap">The figures give diagrams A, B,
C, and D of an apparatus useful
for the preparation of lactic foods.
The incubating can A, is made of
block tin, and is intended to contain
the milk. B, the warm water
container, should be a stout walled
vessel with a circular aperture in
the lid, through which the incubating
can may be passed, and
clamped down as in C.<br /><br />

B is fitted with three stout iron
legs, which should be sufficiently long to allow of a small lamp or gas-jet
being placed beneath the container to maintain a uniform temperature.<br /><br />

D gives an external view of the apparatus.<br /><br />

For the preparation of soured milk, separated milk is placed in the
incubating can, and heated up to 100&deg; C. (212&deg; F.) for thirty minutes.
It is then allowed to cool to room temperature, and the culture, or tablet
containing the lactic acid bacteria, is then added, and thoroughly
stirred for a minute or so. The can is then immersed in the warm
water container and kept at a temperature of 86&deg; F. to 104&deg; F., according
to the organisms used, for ten to twelve hours. By the end of this
time the milk ought to be converted to a jelly-like mass, and after
being stirred vigorously for a short time, may be cooled on ice, and is
then ready for consumption.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>The incubating temperature could very conveniently
be maintained by an electric radiator,
and as the insulation would largely prevent
leakage, the amount of electric current used would
not be large. The regulating apparatus might
consist of a thermometer with platinum wires
fused through the stem at the proper temperature,
say 100&deg; F. When the mercury rises to this
figure it will complete the circuit of a battery
which will actuate certain well-known devices
for turning off the current which actuates the
radiator. In this way a very fine automatic
arrangement would be achieved. Steam pipes
might be used instead of the radiator, and the
thermometer above described could be used in
this case also, with appliances to cut off the steam.</p>

<p>On the large scale, labour-saving appliances,
such as the mechanical brush jar and bottle
washer, and the automatic filler for jars or bottles,
would be employed, and an overhead trackway for
carrying the trays of jars from the steriliser to the
incubator would be a great convenience. A
further adjunct of considerable importance would
be a cold room, worked either by ice or a refrigerating
machine, in which the jars could be stored
after incubation, so as to arrest the process of
lactification, and maintain the soured milk in
good condition until required for use.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER VIII</h4>

<h5>SOURED MILK IN HEALTH AND DISEASE</h5>


<p>When people are ill the best thing they can do
is to place themselves in the hands of the doctor,
who will try to regulate their lives, including their
diet, in accordance with the conditions which
science suggests as the most likely to lead to their
recovery.</p>

<p>It is not the aim of this book to teach persons
who should be under medical treatment to doctor
themselves; soured milk may or may not be
beneficial in their case&mdash;that is for the medical
man to say; and further, if it should be beneficial
the doctor ought to have its preparation
under his control. Slight differences in quality
and purity may count for much in cases of acute
disease, differences which might not matter to
the person who requires no medical attention,
and who consumes the article as a health-giving
food. A considerable body of evidence is already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
on record as to the potency in certain cases of
soured milk as a curative agent, and it seems to
have taken its place in medicine as a recognised
remedy.</p>

<p>There is a wide field of usefulness, however,
outside of the strictly medical one. Professor
Metchnikoff has collected many striking examples
of individuals and peoples inhabiting different
parts of the world, who thrive, and in many cases
attain to a great age, and whose diet consists
largely of soured milk. He has made a wide and
general inquiry into the causes which tend to
shorten life, and makes out a strong case in support
of the view that in many cases this is the
result of what is called auto-intoxication or self-poisoning.
In man and in the mammalia generally,
the colon or large intestine is very largely
developed; this organ is not of much value in the
digestion of food, and seems to be chiefly a receptacle
for waste material; it is, as a rule, extremely
rich in bacterial flora, which produce putrefactive
changes in the waste material. As a result
various poisonous principles are evolved, and these
find their way into the blood, accompanied frequently,
there is every reason to believe, by the
injurious bacteria themselves. In this way many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
diseases and ailments are produced which shorten
life. The inquiry then naturally turns to what
is the best way of dealing with this state of matters.
It is known that the bacteria referred to
flourish best in alkaline or at least non-acid surroundings,
and it is known that these conditions
very frequently exist in the large intestine. Acids
are the best antiseptics; they have been used from
time immemorial as preservatives; pickles are
preserved in vinegar or acetic acid, and when
milk is allowed to sour under proper conditions,
the germs of putrefaction are destroyed or their
activity inhibited, and it keeps a considerable
time. Doubtless, in hot countries, it was this
property of lactic acid which first led to milk being
artificially soured with a view to its preservation
as an article of food. So powerful is lactic acid
in this respect that it is a custom in some countries
to preserve meat by placing it in soured milk.</p>

<p>How can acids be applied so as to control the
bacterial flora of the large intestine? Not in the
ordinary way, because, when administered through
the mouth, they are used up long before they can
penetrate to the colon. The brilliant idea occurred
to Professor Metchnikoff, of administering acid-producing
germs which might work their way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
through the digestive system, and, reaching the
large intestine, produce the acid required. After
much experimenting the bacillus of Massol, <i>Bacillus
bulgaricus</i>, was adopted as the most suitable.
The Bulgarian bacillus is an extremely vigorous
one, multiplying with great rapidity, and persisting
in conditions that would be inimical to
other microbes. The growth and development
of bacteria is interfered with by the products of
their own activity; thus, ordinary lactic-acid-producing
organisms die when a certain amount
of lactic acid has been developed; the same fate
overtakes the Bulgarian bacillus, but it survives
longer and is able to produce as much as two and
one half per cent. of lactic acid in milk before it
ceases operations. It seemed therefore the most
likely to be able to survive the journey through
the digestive system. Experiments fully bore out
this supposition, as no great difficulty was encountered
in naturalising the Bulgarian bacillus
in the large intestine, not only in milk cultures,
but grown in solution of malt, bouillon, etc. It
thrives in all kinds of sugar, and therefore can be
administered in a variety of media, very beneficial
results following in many cases. Direct tests
showed a large reduction of the injurious intestinal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
flora when the Bulgarian bacillus had been naturalised
in the colon, and the bacillus persisted
long after it had ceased to be administered.
Specialists who have taken up the subject report
the cure of many ailments through the agency
of soured milk, and it seems to have entered upon
a lengthening career of medical usefulness.</p>

<p>The fact of so many old people being found in
countries where soured milk is a staple of diet
naturally raises the question as to whether its
general use in other countries might not have a
beneficial effect on health and longevity. Its
usefulness as a remedial agent in certain diseases
is already demonstrated; is there not a strong
probability, amounting almost to a certainty,
that its consumption by people in health would
tend to ward off many ailments and prolong
life? Of course there will be some for whom
it is not suitable; there are people who cannot
eat strawberries without discomfort, but no one
thinks of prohibiting the general use of the fruit
on that account. In the matter of diet the person
in health, if he exercises ordinary care, may be
left to find out for himself what suits him. The
soured milk remedy is not a disagreeable one,
as, when properly prepared, the article forms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
both a pleasant and refreshing article of diet.
The question of getting the right article, however,
is a very important one. Milk is a splendid
rearing ground for many bacteria, some of which
are very injurious; among these may be pathological
germs, the seeds of tuberculosis, enteritis,
etc. The danger with soured milk is, that in the
process of culture we develop the best condition
for the increase of these when they preponderate,
or when, through the use of bad cultures, the
lactic-acid-producing bacteria are absent, or present
only in small numbers. By the thorough
boiling of the milk, we get rid of all living bacteria
and nearly all spores or germs, and by scrupulous
cleanliness in the vessels used&mdash;scalding or
even boiling them, and allowing them to dry
naturally in an inverted position&mdash;we greatly
diminish the probability of infection with fresh
injurious germs from the atmosphere. All depends
on the purity of the culture employed;
this can now be obtained, prepared in the most
careful manner, from wholesale chemists making
a speciality of its manufacture.</p>

<p>As we have seen, even the Bulgarian bacillus
is ultimately killed by the products of its own
activity, and the natural corollary is, that the life
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
of cultures cannot be a long one. Only those
cultures should be bought which are labelled with
the date to which they are guaranteed to maintain
their efficiency. With fresh good milk,
careful boiling, scalding, and cleanliness with
regard to the containing vessels, and the means
of maintaining the incubating temperature for
ten or twelve hours, there is not the slightest
difficulty in preparing perfectly reliable soured
milk. There are simple tests which will sufficiently
guide the experimenter; the soured milk
should not be too acid to the taste, and it has a
flavour of its own by which its quality can be
recognised. The litmus test-papers mentioned in
the chapter on the chemistry of milk are very
useful; both the red and the blue papers should
be obtained and used first of all in testing the
quality of the fresh milk. After incubation the
soured milk should turn the blue paper decidedly
red; if this does not occur, test it with the red
paper; if the latter turns blue it is proof that the
wrong fermentation has taken place&mdash;that putrefactive
germs have gained the upper hand. The
most probable explanation is, that the culture is
bad, the Bulgarian bacillus is not present, or if
so, only in small numbers. With these simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
tests, combined with proper care, one cannot
go far wrong. The Eastern nations who prepare
soured milk in various forms do not exercise the
care we have predicated, but they seem to make
the article of fairly constant and good quality.
It has been suggested in explanation that, as the
ordinary flora differs in different countries, the
bacterial flora varies in a similar manner, and
that in these Eastern countries injurious bacteria
are not so prevalent in the atmosphere as they are
with us.</p>

<p>It is also said that the flavour of the soured
milk prepared in Bulgaria is quite different from
that prepared in Paris, London, or New York;
one reason probably is that the "maya" or ferment
used in Bulgaria contains several other
organisms besides the Bulgarian bacillus, which
raises the question whether a pure culture of one
bacillus is the best to use.</p>

<p>Professor Metchnikoff found that this bacillus
alone had certain defects; it attacks fat and is
apt to give a tallowy taste when cream is present
in the milk. He therefore associated with it
another lactic-acid-producing organism, and this
combination is the basis of his culture called
"lactobacilline." The presence of yeasts, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
occur in the Eastern ferments, has been advocated
by some; the yeast in association with the lactic
organisms produces a small amount of alcohol.
The question of the composition of the culture
will have to be fought out by the experts, but
meantime, if we go to the right source, we have
good enough cultures to go on with.</p>

<p>A good deal can be said for the use of skimmed
or separated milk instead of whole milk. Cream
as a rule contains far more bacteria than the rest
of the milk, and we therefore start from a surer
foundation when it is removed; besides, the
mechanical separator, now so largely used, removes
slime and other impurities from the milk,
and these also are hotbeds of bacteria.</p>

<p>Soured milk may be taken at any time, the
first thing in the morning, before or after meals,
or the last thing at night. The quantity will
vary with the individual, but from half a pint to
a pint is a fair amount for daily use. If one
wishes to have the maximum effect it is necessary
for the time being to curtail the use of butcher's
meat and substitute fish, yolk of eggs, and other
similar foods; not much alcohol should be taken,
and smoking might be reduced to a minimum.
Those who cannot take even skimmed milk may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
use whey in which to cultivate the bacillus; it
is not desirable to employ the whey which has
been separated by the use of rennet, as in cheese- or
junket-making. A better article is obtained
by adding a very small quantity of pure hydrochloric
acid to milk which has been boiled, and
then filtering through a sieve, which retains the
curd while the liquid whey passes through; a
pinch of soda is added to neutralise the excess of
acid, and, after boiling, the liquid should turn
red litmus paper blue; it is then ready for the
addition of the culture and incubation in the
same manner as with milk. A solution of malt&mdash;the
extract dissolved in hot water is convenient&mdash;may
also be used instead of milk, and strongly
malted bread or biscuits are excellent to take with
the soured milk or cultures in other mediums,
to supply food for the bacillus in the form of malt
sugar. Other sugars, cane or grape, are also very
useful, and may be taken in the form of fruit
juices, syrups, confections, jams, sweet puddings,
etc.</p>

<p>We lay stress on the use of soured milk or other
cultures of the Bulgarian bacillus by people in
health as a probable preventive of disease and a
possible agent in the lengthening of life, but it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
may be of interest to give a short account of its
use by medical men in the treatment of various
ailments. An English authority on the subject,
Dr. Herschell, states that the symptoms of the
poisoning of the system by the toxic substances
produced by injurious bacteria in the large intestine
may include headaches, misery and depression
of spirits, drowsiness and stupor, giddiness,
dimness of sight and dizziness, fatigue without
obvious cause, both of the muscles and brain,
fear, panic, and nervousness, disagreeable sensations
in the limbs or face, such as numbness,
tingling, or prickling, crawling sensation of weight
or of heat or cold, dyspepsia of the sort where there
is a deficiency of hydrochloric acid and pepsin
in the gastric juice, accompanied by flabbiness
and loss of power in the muscles of the stomach,
and characterised by flatulence, nausea, loss of
appetite, with discomfort and weight after food,
furred tongue, emaciation, earthy colour of the
skin, offensive perspiration and the other signs
of biliousness, enlargement of the liver, and
an&aelig;mia. These symptoms may have other causes,
and when one or several of them are present a
chemical and physical examination of the urine
and f&aelig;ces is necessary to prove that they have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
resulted from auto-intoxication. When this is
shown the soured milk treatment is indicated,
and many striking cures are detailed as witnesses
to its efficacy. The liver and kidneys are the
natural guardians of the body against the toxines
we are speaking of, and frequently they are over-strained;
the soured milk treatment greatly
lightens their load. In malignant disease of the
stomach, soured milk will frequently be retained
when all other foods are rejected. In cases of
neurasthenia and gout it has also proved of value,
and in the "run-down" condition which is so
common in middle life. Chronic diarrh&oelig;a and
certain forms of constipation have in numerous
instances yielded to the treatment, the whey
culture being usually found the most suitable.
Then, in some forms of an&aelig;mia, the lactic acid
cultures have proved most successful, and, as a
means of rendering the gastro-intestinal track
aseptic previous to operations, they have proved
of considerable value.</p>

<p>If all this has been accomplished in a year or
two, what may not we look forward to in the
future when more extended use and experiment
shall have more fully exhausted the possibilities
of the cure? But if we follow the example of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
different nations who have so long used soured
milk as a regular article of diet, does it not seem
probable that we may eliminate some, at least, of
the causes of ill-health that call for the intervention
of the doctor?</p>

<p>The human organism is by no means perfect;
we have within us many defective parts, and some
organs whose working seems to be against the
welfare of the economy. It has now been clearly
shown that one of the chief of these is the large
intestine, as to the use of which only vague and
unsatisfactory theories have been formed. There
can be no doubt as to the damage which it frequently
inflicts on the system, and, thanks to
the researches of Professor Metchnikoff and other
investigators, we seem to be in possession of a
natural remedy which is sufficient to deal with
the evils it produces.</p>

from Bogoyavlensky's in the use of a larger quantity of millet-flour,
and in the boiling of the latter apart from the milk. Dr. Postnikof's
plan is the following: Half a pound of millet-flour and a quarter of a
pound of malt are mixed with a sufficient quantity of honey to form a
paste, which is put into a clean jar, covered with a linen cloth, and
placed on a warm stove. The mass soon begins to rise, and is then taken
out, wrapped in a piece of muslin, and dropped into a clean earthenware
vessel, containing about a quart of new mares' milk, which is
placed in the same temperature that the paste was kept in. As soon as
signs of fermentation begin to show themselves in the fluid, the paste
must be removed, while the milk, after being stirred, should be left
in the same temperature till bubbles appear (only in very small quantities)
on its surface. The ferment is then ready."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">34</span></a> In their studies on Leben in the <i>Annales de l'Institut Pasteur</i> of
1899, Rist and Khoury, in speaking of the amount of lactic acid produced
by <i>Streptobacillus lebenis</i> in milk, say "Nous avons mesur&eacute;
cette acidit&eacute; dans une culture sur petit lait de vingt-quatre heures;
elle &eacute;tait .261 grms. per cent. exprim&eacute;e en acide lactique," which will
make the amount of lactic acid produced in one litre of milk 2.61 grms.
The production of this small amount of lactic acid does not tally with
the ordinary view of the vigorous lactic-acid-producing power of the
bacillus.</p></div>

<p class="small">As the application of the present day interpretation of Radium (that it is an element
undergoing spontaneous disintegration) is not confined to the physical sciences, but has
a wide and general bearing upon our whole outlook on Nature, Mr. Soddy has presented
the subject in non-technical language, so that the ideas involved are within reach of the
lay reader. No effort has been spared to get to the root of the matter and to secure
accuracy, so that the book should prove serviceable to other fields of science and investigation,
as well as to the general public.</p>

<p>It is not often that a scientific book may be read with
ease, profit, and pleasure by the general reader, so that
M. Metchnikoff's book comes in the nature of an agreeable
surprise. It is marked by a refreshing <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> and a large
simplicity which are characteristically Russian. The scientific
importance of this work is so great that it is spoken of
in England as the most valuable production since Darwin's
<i>Origin of Species</i>.</p>

<hr />

<h5>
Opinions of the Press</h5>


<p class="small">"An extremely interesting and typical book.... With a distinguished
frankness, M. Metchnikoff defines his attitude to our universal
prepossessions. It is his theory that the infirmities of age are to be
overcome. If there be ground for this conception, humanity is to be
profoundly changed and what we call life now, will be the childhood
and youth of that longer and larger life."&mdash;<span class="smcap">H. G. Wells</span>, in <i>London
Speaker</i>.</p>

<p class="small">"Undoubtedly a great book (in some quarters it has been hailed as
the greatest since Darwin's famous message to the world) and should
be read by all intelligent men and women."&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>M. &Eacute;lie Metchnikoff is one of those rare scientists who
have found a way to lay hold of and present to the world in
untechnical phraseology, intelligible to the lay mind, such
results of his researches as are of universal interest and go
straight home to the bosoms and business of intelligent men.
<i>The Nature of Man</i>, by the same author, was one of the most
fascinating books, at once popular, and scientific, which have
appeared for decades. The book here in question will stand
beside it as a worthy companion volume. It is satisfactory
to report that, absorbed as Metchnikoff is in "material"
problems, and deep as he is in the mysteries of the physical
universe, these essays show him to be an optimist who speaks
with no uncertain voice.</p>

<p>A great deal of attention is given in <i>The Prolongation of
Human Life</i> to the subject of old age and its causes, with
scientific observations of special cases among human beings
and the lower animals. The author suggests means of prolonging
life and health, while contemplating natural death
with serenity, and finding that agreeable sensations accompany
its approach. Beyond a certain point it seems to him a disadvantage
to prolong life. Passing on from these mortuary
lucubrations, the essays concern themselves with psychological
matters, with optimism and pessimism and in general with
questions of science and morals. The temperaments of certain
great men are analyzed in studies that have for their subjects
respectively Byron, Leopardi, Schopenhauer, and Goethe. In
the preface the author says that he has avoided, as far as
possible, repeating points which have been sufficiently treated
in <i>The Nature of Man</i>.</p></div>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
